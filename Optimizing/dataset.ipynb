      "📝 Sentence: Just forget it again my rimp sorry I got a couple of things I think we definitely have a stronger definition that I've done as part of progress is delivery right and so part of something done is it needs to run at scale and getlab.com successfully and not below the cost model not below performance and if it does it's just getting to be reverted frankly and that should be the bar for getting features across the line that doesn't mean for new features you know that have low usage that you know I was they're impeccably quite small but these still it needs to be within reason I totally agree that you don't want to over build on the first iteration for planning for millions of users because that's just making a sense but yeah I think that's one aspect I think their aspect is that on your comment press run pricing and we can maybe have a fallout here on like a handbook update but I think it's interesting that customer ritual absorb the cost on self-managed of compute and so for them if they want to have a ridiculous number of you know mirrors then you know it's fine because they're paying for it so use cases on their dime and so maybe a way to think about this is to have some level of controls you can set if you want to use the several that sort of I don't have have some way to control that in a matter of behavior for when we're covering the cost of those things but yeah anyways thank you all great topic Christopher please pile on that issue with thoughts on how to how to handle this like you're suggesting on definition of done Josh all right Karina six and seven yes so I submitted an MR for the product template yesterday and we're going through this process of getting more self-organized in the release area and with our engineering and user design partners and you know one of the things that we recognize and it's documented in the issue below in number seven is you know one our delivery percentage has not been great what you heard me talk about but it has been a complete ramp that we need to self-organize around some method and what we found and sort of the last prioritization for a release scope is that we have a lot of oversized issues and features that you know honestly need a need a beat or a release to go through user research maybe look at the code if they've never seen the code you know reviewed that piece of code before or makes the recommendations on the best way to solve so I put some thinking around you know that sort of you know that dual track mindset dual track agile kind of launching off of what user experience has recently updated for dual track agile so feedback on that and then the second piece is that this experiment or running is releverging semi dual track agile approach just to organize our conversation how we open issues for areas that we need a discovery beat versus presenting an issue that is actually ready for delivery one thing that was interesting Scott we were talking about you know just the kickoff call and having some you know you know images and and more to share that's definitely where I think we'd like to be with release is getting ahead of that curve and really having some concrete understanding and prototypes of what we're trying to to present and deliver but when we looked at sort of kind of going through that process you know this is really four complex things or heavy lifting because you know it is about a 20 to 30 day lead time to commit so just and so we have some targets um to improve um you know our hypothesis on leveraging this um you can follow it there if you have input but um it could they kind of tie together but I love input on the handbook piece thank you Karina for creating these and sharing these I think you're on the right track um in parallel I've been working with like Christopher and Eric and Kristi to outline a high-level description of our software development life cycle which will have two tracks this is sort of competing content there or maybe or maybe they could be merged so thank you for doing this I may slow roll it a little bit to make sure that we have one way of describing the flow we'd like to go through but thank you very much for getting it kicked off any questions for Karina if not Josh what do you yeah just a risk announcement you just went through renamed the promised label to playing priority um general meaning is large of the same although we shouldn't be promising features and so this is just a way to flag it um and uh that way it's reminder for pms that this issue had some importance left with additional dependencies um and so just be aware of it um so you can feel free to use it um I did note in the label text that it should only be applied by product managers and in particular the responsible five manager for that section um so it shouldn't be applied by cams or anyone else so awesome I like that terminology a lot better thank you Josh all right five minutes of spare anything

      "📝 Sentence: Yeah I just thought I'd uh share this um for many I think many on this call haven't heard Mark Kumsbach speak about um product discovery sprints that he advocated that there's quite a number of times previously um from his experience reckoning these at a prior company um so the idea is kind of different to a uh I guess a UX discovery sprint I think Fabian linked one of the books about that where it's really focused on UX iteration and research um the product discovery sprint is more focused on kind of like actually building something iterating on something that's built and trying to get to some sort of NVC really quickly by trying to make the process more synchronous so um the source code group is going to try and do that around file by file def navigation to solve performance and usability problems um in 12.3 um and I thought it would be interesting to share that because internally we've been wrestling with like how to make this work well in async slash remote environment um so we're looking at trying to confine the participants in a specific time zone so that we can all be available with a significant amount of overlap um but that's also difficult because we have it kind of excludes automatically 50% of the team who are just geographically remote from any of their peers we only have one UX designer that's only available in the European time zone so um some interesting challenges there if it goes well we're going to try and replicate it um a release or two later on a different problem that is also really complicated and hard and we want to make progress on quickly but I'll share any findings we have and if anyone's interested in discussing that with me more um put a meeting my calendar or drop me a message this is great James by the way I think the UX team is going to run well let me just say we have the option to run one with Google Ventures who's one of our investors in that sprint book that Fabian Link 2 was written by a guy from GV they did hundreds of these things with our clients they know what they're doing so if we get a chance to do one with them we should uh we're gonna have to figure out how to do it within our async model though so whatever you learn from yours James please feed that back a super interesting topic I think if we could get good at this asynchronously that would be a breakthrough yeah I think one other interesting challenge is that the sprint sort of terminology is kind of challenging and like it's not sustainable to be doing design sprints or discovery sprints on a daily basis yeah whether or not we were in person or not it's not scalable to actually sprint all the time so choosing the right task is choosing the right time um is I think one of the other challenges I agree yeah you don't want to do this for everything because well if you follow the to the letter it takes a whole week and you're totally dedicated to it which is amazing for focus sake but you can't get anything else done so depending on how we structure this it would need to be done for things that are really big unknowns where dedicating a huge chunk of time like that is worth it and not everything clears that bar yeah I think it's also most relevant for for stages that are very in very interesting in the very beginning kind of like that tyron was like one of their biggest example for Google Ventures when they obviously like solving clinical trials for the world is like super complex problems so they just figured out what is this a thing that we can do so that we can start getting there and I think these are the problems that the design sprints use we used it pretty successfully at my last company around pricing and packaging stuff and ran a bunch of interviews with customers on that so I've seen it work all right okay Christopher number five yeah just want to call out we've over the past month we've had a significant number of outages related to .com and the effect that at least one customer revenue potential and because of that you know we've had some some focus from an executive so I encourage everybody to look at that document you kind of look through it in particular as a couple things from an engineering perspective make you aware of one is as we started infrastructure to development board where we're going to start matching issues up and trying to make sure that if that those could prioritize highly where appropriate particularly for anything that you know affects performance around these issues the other issue that I put in there was one around that's listed specifically which is around the fact of prioritizing p performance availability work so one of the significant features of this up to go recent outage last week was that the register apparently can't handle the load anymore we started digging into it we found a bunch of stuff that we hadn't checked like for instance it's an example rj unit test we're basically going and getting cached and there was no limit on the number of unit tests that could actually be cached so they were getting these like blocks of like several megabytes of data that had to basically be transferred around and read us and that's really what's affecting its performance overall from a caching service perspective so consequently Scott I said that to you I hope that's okay because it feels like it was like you need to help out when it hurts the effect of you know how do we best make sure that we get this kind of systematically going and I just want to make sure that everybody was aware and just kind of open up for discussion if there were any questions or or any feedback or early feedback on it from my perspective I added some comments to it Christopher okay I have an add a chance to look at Paul just about that problem can I ask do we and maybe Mac this is a question for you do we categorize performance issues as bugs we do have a performance label but they should be under under bugs okay yeah this is an example where oftentimes the way we treat performance is a reactionary this is trying to think about a more in a proactive way so like as an example I'll give a horrible example but when I worked at Amazon tags originally when Amazon was created tags were they were expecting this to label you know certain instances and that was it and it turns out that all customers started using like 20 and 30 or 50 tags and they're like what the heck is going on and they realize tags were being used to basically you share environmental information so the VMs could they could put the same drop a code on two different VMs and they could behave differently based on the tag which was a total novel way for customers to use it so then they had the basically limit the number of tags they could use because it wasn't scaling with the system effectively so like this is kind of another example where like I think we got to start thinking in terms of you know like when we create something new a new feature of piece of functionality like what's the cost associated with that right because like it does cost something internal and I'm not asking product managers to necessarily think in terms of the exact bytes but I am turning to think in terms of like you know what are the expectations around it because like as an example if we went back and looked at G-Unit tests and reporting you know if we said unlimited that's you know that's a tough engineering call right particularly I guess it's free right now for customers so this is a minor standing we also don't have a number of reposmire we don't have a limit on that and that that seems dangerous yeah so I guess I would comment you know I think the product team is expected to prioritize all things and to understand them deeply whether they're a security issue or a performance concern I think what you're highlighting is in order to be proactive I don't know if the product team would immediately know the impact of a proposed change but maybe that's an opportunity for our infrastructure SRE stable counterparts to be involved in vetting and looking at issues early in the pipeline to decide whether or not they would yeah or or let's say we're implementing a feature like let's say we were implementing mirroring from scratch like the first question we should be asking is is like how many how many mirrors is a customer expected to be able to support and what I want to start charging for if they get above a certain limit and you know and right now we don't and you could argue that scaling is just a much a reason for customers to start paying us as his feature sets that's that's that's that's kind of the argument I would do because those things cost money like whether we like to admit it or not yeah Christopher I would agree with you on what you're trying to sort of shape up and call out here in the sense of you know going through pages for example the performance of getting those page loads loaded is not great and I don't know if we set out originally to track some of those performance things but I think that performance and into your point can I think performance should be somewhere incorporated as we move forward and something we should be thinking about for scalability across the board because it's just as important as bringing forth that really cool thing to them is that that really cool thing works and people will stay there to use it.\n",

      "📝 Sentence: Performance is very much a feature and should be considered that and um I think particularly in categories where adoption is still growing and at early stages of maturity performance like understandably is less of a concern because there's lower usage so like solving scale at like an enormous level doesn't make sense commercially like necessarily when usage is small so there is a bit of a juggling act here because we don't want to build a product for billions of users if there's only I don't know 20,000 users experimenting with our newest feature so there's an iterative approach that needs to be taken but I would agree that particularly coming from a team that's digging out a lot of technical debt and solving a lot of performance problems all the time we're probably historically not being very good at picking the right moment to pay off technical debt and address performance problems until they become fires so yeah so to to that point just real quick James and sorry Scott um I think some things are obvious like when we look at our progressive deliveries um strategy I think that we like if you look at something like feature flags or something like that like that's something that I think is going to be like I wouldn't imagine that that's not going to be a key feature that we're going to bring forward um so I feel like that should be a give me on whether adoption has yet struck or not but the second thing that is not clear to me like again when I was interviewing Marin about dog fooding is that I noticed that Marin's like we don't this isn't we weren't they didn't come to us first and so this is not scalable or this is not usable for us internally and so it's like the the approach and process moving forward to dog food in the right spots is not clear to me or you know what the best practice has been or if anybody's you know crack that yeah I can give a concrete example is I did a call with Marin a few months back around confidential merger quests um so we knew that customers wanted to resolve them we knew that we wanted to do that and that we're trying to get rid of dev.gillab.org so I had a video call with him and a bunch of async conversations with like well I've got these ideas for what a first iteration looks like and then we did a few calls and worked through them and worked out which were the things that needed to happen and so we're shipping the first iteration of that in 12.1 but we coordinated with them and spoke I spoke with Marin quite a lot to make sure whatever we were building was useful and would solve the security problems that they had as well as our own ones so yeah I agree it needs to be proactive we're not gonna ship something's useful or that the infrastructure team is gonna want to opt into unless we've had a conversation with them in advance all right it's at 130 set can I add one like last time point it's sometimes really important for customers as well that we're running it on getlab.com before they adopt it so one example is we built ssltls support in Giddily but it's not turned on in getlab.com and so the customer that we built it for isn't using it because they're waiting for our production team to turn it on because they want to see before they turn it on for their enormous instance have we actually proven it at the world's largest getlab instance scale so I think that's one important reason why we always need to make sure that features are on and are getting used on getlab.com.\n",

We have some amount of like we have a stage of you know, a metaphorical stage to say something to the world and we'll get some amount of press attention because we're having an event, right?

And also, Brian about the VS code thing. One other cool thing about that is both of those VS code integrations that hit the same month or community contributions, which is also kind of cool. Is that, do we have VS code listed on here? I didn't add it, but I can add that in. I've got good notes on that. The extension that had been around for a while became official. It was kind of one of the things, but there's some other stuff that's a little juicier than that. And that I think that's a pretty good note as well. We did that with our Terraform module.

There was a community module, but now it's officially supported. So that's the that can be the line, yes or no, whether you can use the thing for a lot of businesses. So I think that's a good one too. How are we measuring excitement levels? One, two, and three. Is there? I was looking at maybe MAU as a metric to perhaps measure whether customers have started using that are interested in using that or not. We probably may not have it for everything, but at least some of it wherever we have it is probably something we can use. But we of course, we need a benchmark level of what MAU we want to call one, two, three. I think it's a little bit of a judgment call. For example, Corn Mack was saying, like, epic boards is something that was asked for for a long time. Now, depending on how it's asked for, maybe that means it's exciting \n",

Now, depending on how it's asked for, maybe that means it's exciting or it's not, right? But usually when something it's a lot of upvotes or when there's a lot of demand for it, then I would I would bump the excitement level on something like that. Certainly, it's something shifted a lot of people are using it, the MAU. That's another good measure. I don't know that any one of those needs to kind of be exclusive. I think it's a bit of a it's a bit of an individual judgment call. I'm just like, what is what is your feeling based on, you know, could be anecdotal like you talked to customers and they're like really hyper excited about this? Or, you know, maybe not, which is okay. I think it's okay. I first responded to my comment about why we have the low excitement ones and just said something about having them sort of stack ranked.

Yeah, I might even constrain this is we're not going to highlight low excitement, but we want to see the full spectrum, especially in the case we have slim pickings. Alternatively, if there are double digit entries, then we can stack rank. So that's that's kind of also helpful there. So if we have three for all of these, that, I mean, it looks like we're going to get there and that's going to be quite a lot of features. So I might constrain it like this. Maybe you can only give out one, one, two, or three. And and treat as a stack rank rather than just like a raw excitement level that doesn't necessarily hard to somebody's one or somebody's three may be more important than somebody else's one. Agreed.

Again, really tough to do at GitLab because it's all been around for a while. So this is this is our attempt ahead to that area is to say like these are the announcements of the event and yeah, maybe it's some things that have been around for a while but like now they're at a level of maturity.

But we also have in terms of proprietary stuff we've also got we replaced one of our scanners with SEMGRIP and we did we have our own proprietary dust scanner now that's in it's in beta called brow zirker so it's our answer to scanning single-page applications which represent a unique challenge.

I would probably say like Kubernetes agent is something that we've made a lot of investment in although I think the Kubernetes agent and from an integration point of view perhaps the Terraform integration I think we have a lot of customers actually using that already. So I'm going to I'm just going to call those get ops and I'm going to put like KSS agents plus sce for integrations. It's like a bucket of capabilities that is probably worth talking about. Cool.

So in the competitive sheet, I was, I mean, I've already identified the features for CD config, as well as monitor, getting it reviewed from PM. My guess was or my understanding was that we wouldn't have the same set of competitors that we're going to compare to, but the right competitors for that particular stage. So for example, for for monitor, we may not have like a GitHub or something like that.

So I just wanted your your input on what's because I saw some of you have compared with the five competitors already listed over there. They may not be relevant. For example, cloud beads may not be relevant for monitor stage at all. So that's what I wanted to check through. Yeah, that's the case. I need to go back and look at this spreadsheet. I mean, if the competitor does not apply for that particular stage, they shouldn't be on that tab in this spreadsheet. So are you saying that you see competitors on that tab for a stage where they don't apply? Yeah. I think it was copy pasted. Each one has the same. Yeah.

I think we identified top three competitors for every stage. Yeah, that's when we tiered them. tier one, tier two, two, three. So this, this, where we are right now is we're looking at just tier one competitors. That's probably why I cut and paste them because those are all tier ones. We're just focusing on tier one right now. So if they don't apply to that stage, don't worry about it. Make sense. So just pick the ones out of that list that apply to our stage. Right. I just, we just use the tier one competitors and if they're not, if they don't, are not applicable, then we don't have to fill out anything for that. Yeah, for now, but th\n",

Yeah, for now, but then we'll move to tier two and tier three. Then we'll look at those other. Okay. Do we need to add a line item for GitLab as well because I think that's the single we're here. Yeah, we should, I think you asked me that before, right? Or someone asked me? I'm just looking at it. Brian asked.Yeah, because the way without it, you're basically putting all the things that we're better at. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Yeah. Right. So, ideally, when we picked like the 10 to 15 features, though some of those were like GitLab only, some of those were like GitLab didn't have. Well, I thought it was supposed to be that none of them should be GitLab only, right? It should be all through the lens of. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, it should be like market lens.

Some, like some of them might be GitLab only, some of them might be like competitor only, so that it's a, somebody would look at it and be like, this looks honest and trustworthy and like an accurate assessment of the market. Yeah. And then, yeah, I think, Simon, for this, just to kind of reiterate, for this one, we're only doing these five competitors. So, we'll do the other ones in a later stage. And then, for, if the vendor builds, like, builds themselves as a platform, then we should specifically call out that they have zero. So, GitLab builds itself as a platform. It sells itself that way.

That is a matter of fact that I go back and add Atlassian because I, based on conversation, I think we have to do it. I don't think we can leave them off. I have to look at this version. Atlassian is on that sheet. Okay. Yeah. I went back and added them because based on discussion, like my, I wanted to take them off completely and just leave them as a partner, but we can't do that. So, yeah. So, for those platform, you know, we should call out the fact that they don't have any monitoring. If they have like zero out of 15, we should call that out.

That has to be determined, reconciled, all this kind of stuff. Like the, you know, we kind of, I don't know how long it's been since we updated those pages have like not been updated.

Manage is even less descriptive than that. So, so the way this is getting built is off of a data model. So in theory, these could change or be updated where the underlying data remains the same, right? Because like we're separating like presentation layer from data layer. So that's, it's not going to be as hard to update in the future as it currently is where it's a mess of spaghetti code and it's like really, really difficult update.

There's being the audience coming in and not knowing anything about these specific stages. That was one of the big things. It's like, okay, 15, 15 features. What? What is what are they? Why do I care? You know, they're paying better? Yeah. That means to say that means nothing to me looking at this, this page. But quick question. No, we're on top of it.

Yeah, the only thing it might be missing, but I don't know how we do it without over complicating it is well, I guess less risk also implies higher quality. I guess that kind of bundles the quality and the security together. So I've talked myself out of not liking that. So yeah, good.

It was like secure the software factory and all the stuff that you're making. She said it really elegant. And it's deliverables. Secure the self factory and it's deliverables. Yeah, I thought it was good to emphasize both because they mean that it's nuts. Yeah. Yeah, so you could say secure and control your software factory and it's deliverables. Maybe that would encompass both thoughts. I'm not a big fan of the it's deliverables. Is there a can we say like your software factory and your software or your your software or your product.

It's security is going to catch that. All of those elements that allow you to move faster but to do so with confidence because otherwise you're like the faster you go than it gets more dangerous. So trying to encapsulate that in this like that was kind of where I was like stay on track, but I didn't like it either. Did you just open the door for a NASCAR partnership?

      "* Cloudbees and Jenkins do not have monitoring capabilities\n",
      "* Atlassian's limitations in terms of monitoring and configuration are being reconsidered, but the speaker initially wanted to exclude them as a platform option entirely.\n",
      "* The speaker suggests that if a platform has limited or no capabilities, it should be called out.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 28 ---\n",
      "The transcript appears to be a meeting discussion between two or more people, likely colleagues in a professional setting. Here's a summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "* One person suggests that if the company achieves \"zero\" out of 15 in a certain metric (likely a product stage), they should acknowledge it.\n",
      "* Another person agrees and proposes using a value-based description to describe the progress instead of just stating the product stage.\n",
      "* The discussion turns to an infographic created by the design team, which has not been shared with the group yet. One person is unable to find it in their notes or tabs but finds it through a Google search on Gmail.\n",
      "* Someone else offers to share the link, and the conversation continues with the task of sharing the information among the group.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 29 ---\n",
      "The meeting transcript appears to be a conversation about workflow and project management tools, specifically discussing the use of GitLab for a presentation or report. \n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker seems to have found multiple versions of a document they were looking for on Gmail, which led them to their GitLab folder where they stored related files. They mentioned that after exploring different options, they decided to simplify the workflow by using stages in GitLab.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation highlights the challenges of managing complex projects and updating documentation, but also suggests a willingness to make progress and adapt processes as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 30 ---\n",
      "The meeting transcript appears to be discussing updates to a website or application. The speakers seem to agree that the current configuration is outdated and not descriptive enough. They mention using a data model to build the site, which allows for easier updates in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key points mentioned are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The current state of the site is \"off\" due to outdated configuration.\n",
      "* A new approach is being taken, separating the presentation layer from the data layer.\n",
      "* This should make it easier to update the site in the future without disrupting its functionality.\n",
      "* There are still some components that need to be completed or updated before the next iteration can proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speakers seem to be taking a pragmatic approach to updating the site, prioritizing progress over perfection, and looking forward to making improvements in subsequent iterations.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 31 ---\n",
      "The speaker is discussing a meeting or conversation with someone ( likely a team lead or colleague) and appears to be frustrated with the progress of an upcoming feature or component. \n",
      "\n",
      "Key points from the transcript include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The person wants something live, but only after a verification step that will take place in the next iteration.\n",
      "- They express concern about new features being added without proper explanation, hoping to avoid confusing audience who may not understand these stages.\n",
      "- There's confusion about payment rates and how they're relevant to understanding certain pages or components.\n",
      "- The speaker mentions that another person has mentioned an issue with implementing something \"right now\", but it seems like a minor point. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speaker is expressing frustration with the pace of development and seeking clarity on various aspects of their project.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 32 ---\n",
      "The speaker appears to be discussing a design concept with others in a meeting. They mention that they had previously discussed the idea of removing red from the design, which was agreed upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker likes the current color scheme because it avoids being \"obviously negative\" and instead presents a more subtle message. They believe this is beneficial for comparisons with other organizations, as it allows for a nuanced assessment rather than simply stating that one organization is worse than another.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall goal of the project is to create a helpful asset for the industry, rather than a marketing gimmick. The speaker wants the design to be informative and useful, not just promotional.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 33 ---\n",
      "The meeting transcript appears to be about creating an industry resource page comparing DevOps tools. The speaker expresses their desire to create a helpful asset that is not promotional, but rather informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "They mention considering different design options (green and red/yellow) for the page, but ultimately decide to stick with a recommendation from someone who did not participate in the meeting (as indicated by \"I don't know\").\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also mentions that they received some information on Friday (or late Thursday), but do not elaborate further. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the main topic is the creation of an informative resource page about DevOps tools, and the discussion revolves around the design and content aspects of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 34 ---\n",
      "The speaker appears to be discussing a meeting or project they were assigned to work on. They mention feeling like they jumped into the project quickly and didn't have much context, but are trying to make the most of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They explain that their task was to fill in boxes with messaging framework ideas, such as \"transparent\" and \"single source of truth.\" The speaker seemed pleased with some of these options, including \"countless possibilities\" and \"all in one for everyone,\" which they found catchy. However, they acknowledged that not everyone may share their enthusiasm for these ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker's tone is informal and conversational, suggesting a casual or creative project rather than a formal business or professional setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 35 ---\n",
      "The speaker seems to be discussing a meeting where they presented their assignment and some of their ideas for a project or presentation. They mention writing pithy statements about different aspects of a \"software factory\" concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "They seem pleased with their own work, particularly the statement about having \"end-to-end control over your software factory\". However, they compare it to another slide that doesn't have any information under security, suggesting that this slide was just an iteration or addition by someone else (likely themselves).\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also seems to like some of the other statements, but not all. They express a preference for certain words or phrases, such as \"automate nearly anything\" and \"collaborate on everything\".\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 36 ---\n",
      "The meeting transcript appears to be a conversation between two individuals discussing a set of statements or options. The speaker expresses their opinions on the statements, indicating that they prefer certain phrases over others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, the speaker says:\n",
      "\n",
      "- They don't like \"scale up speed up test up\" because it sounds goofy and implies no one tests.\n",
      "- They love the phrase \"I love it or hate it\".\n",
      "- When asked to identify a statement they couldn't choose, the speaker explains that they prefer parity in tone across different elements of messaging. They also express dislike for a single source of truth being tied to specific phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there seems to be some confusion as the transcript ends abruptly and doesn't provide further details or context about the statements or options being discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 37 ---\n",
      "The transcript appears to be a meeting discussion about marketing slogans or taglines for GitLab. The speaker is expressing their preference for certain phrases, including \"move fast with confidence\" and \"less risk, more speed,\" which they think convey the company's values effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "They acknowledge that some phrases may overlap in meaning, such as the idea of \"higher quality\" being implied by \"less risk.\" However, they don't see this as a weakness, but rather an opportunity to combine related concepts into a cohesive message.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also mentions that Cindy's previous blog post had a notable phrase, \"secure the software factory,\" which they found inspiring.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 38 ---\n",
      "The transcript appears to be a conversation between two people, likely in a professional or creative context, discussing a blog post by Cindy. They're brainstorming ways to rephrase her phrase \"secure the software factory\" and its accompanying ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "One person suggests adding \"and deliverables\" to emphasize both security and control of the software product. However, they express some discomfort with this phrasing, preferring alternatives such as \"your software or your product\" or simply \"IP\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation also touches on tone and style, with one participant joking about channeling their inner \"Ash Wither\" ( likely a reference to the character from a book or TV series). The overall tone is casual and collaborative.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 39 ---\n",
      "The transcript appears to be a meeting discussion about a product or idea. The speakers are trying to decide on a name for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One person is suggesting \"velocity\" as an option, but seems to be moving away from it after hearing another opinion (not explicitly stated in the transcript, but implied by the context). \n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then shares their thought process, referencing Ash Wednesday and its symbolism. They compare the idea of giving users a single source of truth with countless possibilities to the concept of Ash Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "They seem to be leaning towards a different name, \"velocity with confidence\", which is presented as more appealing than just increased speed. The reference to holding out a sign in a bike race illustrates their point about stability and reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 40 ---\n",
      "This transcript appears to be a conversation about a meeting or discussion at GitLab. The speaker is struggling to summarize their point, using analogies such as a bike race to convey the idea of speed and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "They seem to be trying to say that they were going for a concept called \"stay on track,\" but didn't like it. They then joke about potentially partnering with NASCAR, suggesting that GitLab's technology could help them go faster, implying that the speaker might have been open to collaboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the conversation quickly devolves into unclear discussion and the speaker expresses uncertainty about their own point.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 41 ---\n",
      "This appears to be a meeting transcript discussing a slogan or tagline for a NASCAR partnership with Git Lab. The speaker is not entirely satisfied with the initial suggestion, which they think lacks \"parity\" and doesn't convey the desired message.\n",
      "\n",
      "They propose modifying the original idea by adding phrases such as \"high confidence\" or \"more speed, less risk.\" However, the speaker also notes that \"confidence\" is an overused term in marketing and prefers a phrase like \"just this is how it is,\" which conveys a sense of directness and no trade-offs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker's engineer background leads them to caution against the idea of \"no trade offs,\" as they believe there are always risks involved. Instead, they advocate for a more nuanced approach that acknowledges potential trade-offs.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 42 ---\n",
      "This meeting transcript appears to be a humorous and informal discussion between colleagues. The conversation starts by highlighting the importance of mitigating risk, with one person joking about there being \"no trade offs\" (i.e., 100% secure). Another colleague responds that it's not possible to eliminate all risks, but rather strive for \"more speed less risk with confidence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The tone quickly shifts to a lighthearted and playful discussion about the movie \"Taladega Nights,\" with one person referencing the film in an enthusiastic manner. The conversation ends with a humorous anecdote about someone not having seen the movie, which leads to a tongue-in-cheek remark about people who haven't watched it being like they're playing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final sentence (\"I say thank you little eight pound five ounce baby Jesus...\") seems out of place and may be a joke or a quirky habit of one of the participants. Overall, this transcript appears to be an entertaining and unstructured discussion between colleagues.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 43 ---\n",
      "This appears to be a meeting transcript, but it's more informal than traditional. The speaker seems to have had a casual conversation with the team about their upcoming activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key points from the transcript are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* They mentioned planning some fun activities for later, specifically \"Taladega Nights\" and \"Step Brothers\", which suggests they enjoy humor and light-hearted entertainment.\n",
      "* The team member decides to prioritize speed over taking extra risks, possibly implying that time is of the essence.\n",
      "* The speaker seems to be in a good mood and appreciates the collaborative atmosphere, using phrases like \"Keep it rocking\" and \"See you soon\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the tone is relaxed and positive, suggesting a fun and engaging team dynamic.\n",
