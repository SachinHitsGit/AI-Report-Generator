uh  .
um  .
ah  .
er  .
hmm  .
like  .
you know  .
I mean  .
well  .
so  .
okay  .
right  .
just  .
yeah  .
sort of  .
kind of  .
basically  .
actually  .
literally  .
maybe  .
technically  .
I guess  .
I suppose  .
to be honest  .
you see  .
you could say  .
at the end of the day  .
thing is  .
look  .
listen  .
frankly  .
honestly  .
apparently  .
somehow  .
more or less  .
at least  .
just so you know  .
just saying  .
if you will  .
I think  .
in my opinion  .
to some extent  .
in terms of  .
for what it's worth  .
as far as I’m concerned  .
as it were  .
as you might imagine  .
as I was saying  .
you know what I mean  .
what I’m trying to say is  .
the thing is  .
I reckon  .
at this point  .
at the moment  .
for now  .
in like  .
you know how  .
I don’t know  .
that being said  .
if that makes sense  .
so to speak  .
if that helps  .
if that’s okay  .
just saying  .
to tell the truth  .
kind of thing  .
sort of thing  .
you know what  .
you know what I’m saying  .
I hope you understand  .
not sure  .
sort of like  .
something like that  .
in a way  .
if you think about it  .
you might say  .
you might think  .
if you ask me  .
to be honest with you  .
for the most part  .
believe me  .
for sure  .
all things considered  .
no kidding  .
you know what I mean  .
just to be clear  .
just to clarify  .
on the other hand  .
either way  .
that said  .
at least I think  .
my bad  .
by the way  .
oh  .
um‑hmm  .
uh huh  .
okay okay  .
so yeah  .
well you know  .
just one moment  
hold on a sec  .
just a moment  .
I'll tell you  .
you know just saying  .
if that makes sense to you  .
I suppose you could say  .
if that works for you  .
you know kind of  .
you know sort of  .
just in case  .
look I’m not certain  .
just trying to say  .
you see what I mean  
just in my head  .
uh just  .
ah yes  .
you know what happened.
Sounds good.
Let’s circle back.
That makes sense.
Let’s take it offline.
We’re aligned on that.
Let me get back to you.
It’s on our radar.
We're working on it.
We’ll follow up.
That’s in progress.
Let’s connect later.
We’ll touch base soon.
It’s in the pipeline.
Still figuring that out.
Let’s stay flexible.
We’re looking into it.
That’s TBD for now.
Let’s regroup on that.
We’ll flag that later.
It's still evolving.
That’s a fair point.
Let’s table that.
That’s under review.
We’re monitoring it.
Noted, thank you.
We're on it.
Let’s revisit that.
Let’s not dwell on that.
We’re aligned.
It’s pending review.
We’ll sync on that.
That’s noted.
Point taken.
Working on next steps.
We’ll handle that.
Let’s park that.
That’s top of mind.
We’re aware of that.
That’s been flagged.
It’s being handled.
Still under discussion.
Thanks for that.
Appreciate that.
Fair enough.
Exactly.
Absolutely.
Sure thing.
Right, right.
Okay, great.
Got it, thanks.
We’ll take care of it.
That’s on our list.
Let me check on that.
We’ll circle back shortly.
It’s being reviewed.
That’s noted on our end.
We’re aware, thanks.
We’ll come back to that.
No worries there.
Let’s hold off on that.
We’re keeping tabs on it.
It’s in consideration.
We’ll loop you in.
Appreciate the heads-up.
We’ll take that onboard.
We're tracking that already.
It’s in motion.
That's being looked at.
I see your point.
We’ll align on that.
Let’s take a pause here.
That’s under control.
Let’s put a pin in that.
Understood, moving on.
Still working through it.
We’ve got that covered.
We’ll ping you soon.
It’s logged internally.
Not a blocker.
We’ll touch base.
Let’s take that offline.
Let’s circle back offline.
We’ll close the loop.
We’ve flagged that.
Already in the queue.
We’ve captured that.
It’s part of the plan.
We’re across that.
Thanks for flagging.
We’ll take a look.
That’s been handled.
Let’s not get into that.
We’re on top of it.
Let’s not derail the flow.
No action needed yet.
Pending internal feedback.
It’s being prioritized.
Nothing to report there.
You know what I mean  .
I don't know if that makes sense  .
It’s like I was saying earlier  .
You know what I'm saying  .
I'm not really sure.
It's just one of those things  .
To be completely honest with you  .
The thing I’m trying to say is  .
So, what I’m trying to say is  .
I mean, it's kind of like  .
I just wanted to point out  .
If that makes any sense at all  .
What I’m trying to get at is  .
I think what I mean is  .
It’s just something to consider  .
So basically, what I’m saying is  .
I guess you could say that  .
Let me put it this way  .
Just to clarify what I mean  .
I think it’s fair to say  .
In a way, you could say that  .
What I meant by that was  .
That’s kind of what I was thinking  .
It’s kind of hard to explain, but  .
It’s not that simple, you know  .
You could sort of say that  .
I guess that’s one way to look at it  .
I’m not sure if you understand what I mean  .
So, just to give you an idea  .
What I meant to say is  .
I don't really know how to explain it  .
What I’m trying to get across is  .
It’s like what I said before  .
It’s not that I don’t know.
Well, it’s kind of like this  .
You could sort of say that  .
I think you get the point  .
I’m not saying that’s true.
I can’t really say for sure  .
I don’t know exactly how to explain this  .
I’m just trying to make a point  .
It’s like I’ve been saying  .
So here’s what I think  .
The point I’m trying to make is  .
I don’t know how to phrase this.
It’s a little complicated to explain  .
What I’m saying is more or less  .
I mean, it’s not like that  .
I’m not trying to say that.
Well, it’s more of a general idea  .
I’m sure you get where I’m coming from  .
You can kind of tell what I mean  .
So in a way, it’s like this.
It’s not that I don’t know.
I don’t have an exact answer for you  .
So, what I’m really trying to say is  .
Let me just clarify that a bit more  .
I’m not sure if that’s entirely true  .
What I mean is something like this  .
I just wanted to add something here  .
That’s a bit hard to explain though  .
It’s kind of a tricky thing to say  .
What I meant was kind of like this  .
I don’t mean it that way at all  .
It’s a bit complicated.
I’m just trying to think of how to explain it  .
What I’m trying to express is . 
I think that’s what I was trying to say . 
It’s kind of tough to get it out.  
I guess what I’m saying is that.  
I’m not sure if that’s completely accurate.  
I just think it’s important to consider.  
It’s more of a gut feeling, you know.  
I think it’s safe to say that.  
What I meant when I said that was.  
So, the point I’m trying to make is.  
I don’t want to get too deep into this. 
Let me just explain it this way.  
It’s kind of a bit tricky.  
I don’t know how else to say this . 
That’s not exactly what I meant.  
It’s like this, but not really.  
So, what I really mean is.  
I’m just trying to wrap my head around it.  
It’s hard to put into words.  
It’s just something to keep in mind.  
I don’t want to complicate things.
I think it’s worth mentioning that.
It’s more of a matter of perspective.
Let me just make sure you’re following me.
I don’t know if that really answers your question.
What I meant by that is.
I’m kind of trying to say something here.
It’s more complicated than you think.
I don’t know how clear I’ve been, but.
I hope I’m making sense here.
I’m not really making my point clear, am I?.
I just want to get this out there.
I guess it all depends on what you mean.  
So yeah, that’s pretty much it.
We’ll follow up with more details later.
That’s something we’re still working through internally.
Let’s revisit that once we have more clarity.
We don’t have a concrete update on that yet.
Let’s touch base on that after the meeting.
That’s a good point — we’ll keep it in mind.
We’re still having conversations around that topic.
There are still a few moving parts there.
We’ll keep that in our back pocket for now.
That’s something we can explore down the line.
We’re keeping an eye on how that evolves.
That’s a conversation for another day, perhaps.
We’re waiting to hear back from other teams.
We’ll loop back once things are more defined.
That’s been surfaced but not yet prioritized.
That’ll depend on a few other variables.
We’re in the early stages of that discussion.
That’s part of a broader conversation we’re having.
There’s still some alignment needed on our end.
We’ll take that under consideration going forward.
We’ve flagged that but haven’t acted on it yet.
We don’t have a firm direction on that yet.
It’s still under active discussion across departments.
Let’s not get into the weeds on that.
We’ll monitor it and update as needed.
That’s been acknowledged and is in the backlog.
We’re currently evaluating the best approach to move forward.
That’s something we’re considering but haven’t finalized yet.
There are a few dependencies we need to resolve first.
We’re waiting on additional data before taking any action.
That’s been flagged but isn’t currently a high priority.
We’ll take that offline and circle back with you later.
We’re still trying to understand the full impact of that.
That’s something that’s evolving as we get more information.
We don’t have enough clarity yet to provide meaningful updates.
Additional data is required before we can take action.
This has been identified but is not a top priority now.
We’ll discuss this offline and reconnect with you later.
We’re still assessing the overall effect of that issue.
This is evolving as more details become available.
We lack sufficient information to provide a solid update.
Let’s pause on this until we gain further clarity.
Valid point, but not ready for action yet.
Coordination with other teams will be necessary on this.
Discussions are ongoing, but no decisions have been made.
We’re resolving some specifics and will share updates soon.
We haven’t yet resolved all the questions around this.
We’ll keep this on our agenda for future discussion.
This issue is still under evaluation by the team.
We need to consult others before finalizing our stance.
That’s part of a larger discussion still underway.
We’re gathering more insights before making any firm conclusions.
That point requires more clarity before we take action.
Um, I'm not sure if that will work right now.
I mean, we could look into it a bit more.
Like, maybe we should reconsider the whole approach here.
Actually, I think we need to take a step back.
You know, it's not as simple as it sounds.
Uh, I guess we could try it, but we'll see.
Well, it's definitely something we should discuss further.
I mean, that's one way to look at it, I guess.
Honestly, I haven't had enough time to fully think about it.
So, I guess we could move forward with it for now.
Like, I'm not entirely convinced, but it might work.
Um, it’s hard to say without more information.
I’m not saying it's bad, just that we need more input.
Uh, maybe it’s best if we hold off for a bit.
So, this is just a suggestion for the moment.
Actually, we might want to explore other options as well.
Well, I think that could work, but let's be cautious.
You know, we should really take a deeper look at this.
Um, I would need to check with the team first.
Maybe we can go over this in more detail next time.
Like, it might make sense to rework this a bit.
Actually, it could be worth discussing at our next meeting.
So, I think we need to give this some more thought.
Uh, that sounds good, but we’ll have to adjust a few things.
You know, it's not something we can finalize right away.
I mean, we should definitely consider all the factors here.
Actually, let’s talk more about this when we have more time.
Um, I don’t think we should rush into this just yet.
Well, I’d need to see the full picture before deciding.
So, we could look at it again and review some things.
Actually, that’s an option we can discuss in our next meeting.
Um, I’m still not fully convinced this is the right direction.
So, maybe we should look at the alternatives a little more.
Actually, I need to check if there are any other options available.
Uh, we could definitely explore this idea further if needed.
Well, we should revisit this idea with a bit more context.
You know, we should look at this from a broader perspective.
I mean, it’s something we could discuss when the time is right.
Um, it might be helpful to get some outside feedback first.
Actually, we can put this on the agenda for our next meeting.
Well, we can give it a shot, but with some adjustments.
Uh, I think we need to align on a few details first.
You know, there are a few things we might be overlooking here.
Actually, it could be good to take another look at this.
So, let’s table this for now and revisit it soon.
Um, we might want to get more data before we proceed.
I think it’s worth exploring, but we need more time.
Well, we could make it work, but we’ll need a better plan.
Actually, we should consider other possible solutions before deciding.
Uh, let’s make sure we’ve got everything lined up first.
You know, it’s something we should definitely keep in mind.
I mean, we may need to tweak a few things along the way.
Actually, I’ll have to think this through a bit more carefully.
Well, we could explore this further after gathering more feedback.
Um, I’m still not entirely sure about the approach we’re taking.
Uh, I think we should loop back to this in a bit.
Actually, we should maybe reframe the question to get a clearer answer.
So, we could probably start here, but let’s check the details.
You know, I think it’s worth investigating a bit deeper.
Uh, it’s definitely something we can look at again later.
I mean, let’s make sure we have all the necessary details first.
So, I think it’s important to gather more insights before making a move.
Actually, it might be wise to take a step back and rethink.
Well, we can’t be sure without looking at a few more details.
Actually, I think it’s a good idea, but we need to be cautious.
You know, we should definitely take a closer look at this before deciding.
Uh, we could potentially go ahead with it, but we need more time.
Well, I think we should gather more opinions before making a final choice.
Actually, it might be worth considering, but let’s discuss it further first.
Um, we might want to take a moment to rethink the entire approach.
Well, that’s definitely something to think about, but let’s not rush it.
Actually, I think we should weigh all the pros and cons before proceeding.
You know, we should revisit this when we have more clarity around it.
Well, we could move forward with that, but I think we should wait.
Actually, I think we need to review the data one more time.
Um, it’s a good idea, but we should probably hold off for now.
Well, let’s look at this again after we get more concrete information.
Actually, I’m not sure this is the best solution, but it’s worth discussing.
Um, I think we could make that work, but we need to plan carefully.
Well, let’s take some time to think this through before deciding.
Actually, it might be helpful to break this down into smaller steps.
You know, I’m not sure if we have enough information to decide yet.
Well, I think we need to get more input before we move forward.
Actually, it could work, but I think we should proceed with caution.
Um, we’ll have to revisit this after we have all the facts in place.
Actually, we should probably revisit the data to ensure we’re making the right choice.
Well, I think we could give it a try, but we need more input.
Well, we could probably go ahead with this, but we need to be extra careful.
Actually, I think we should evaluate this again after we gather more feedback.
Um, I think we might want to hold off on making a decision right away.
Well, I’m not sure if this is the best solution, but it’s worth considering.
Actually, we should definitely revisit the topic after we’ve had more time to think it over.
You know, we might need to reconsider our timeline before moving forward with this plan.
We don’t want to rush the decision before we fully understand the potential impacts.
That requires further analysis and discussion with key decision-makers before we move forward.
We’re waiting on additional feedback from our partners before we can proceed confidently.
That’s part of a larger initiative that’s still in the early stages of development.
We’re prioritizing other urgent matters right now but will circle back to this soon.
There’s still a fair amount of uncertainty that we need to address before acting.
We want to make sure that all concerns are addressed before finalizing any plans.
That’s something we plan to revisit once we have more concrete information available.
We’re actively engaging with stakeholders to ensure all viewpoints are considered carefully.
The timeline for this project is still being finalized, so we’re holding off on decisions.
We’re aware of the challenges and are working to develop a comprehensive response.
It’s critical that we maintain flexibility as the situation continues to evolve rapidly.
We’ll need to evaluate the potential risks carefully before making any firm commitments.
We’re currently assessing all factors involved before making any formal recommendations on this.
There are several dependencies that need to be resolved before we can move forward.
We want to make sure that any changes implemented will deliver long-term value.
There’s a lot of groundwork that needs to be completed before we can finalize plans.
Our team is collaborating closely to ensure alignment across all business units involved.
We recognize the importance of this issue and are dedicating resources accordingly.
We’re committed to transparency and will share updates as soon as they become available.
It’s a balancing act between addressing immediate concerns and planning for the future.
We’ll continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our strategy as needed.
We’re still in the early stages of evaluating potential options and next steps.
Further investigation is needed before we can confidently provide a comprehensive update.
There’s a lot of information to review before we decide on the best course.
We’re gathering insights from across teams to better inform our upcoming decisions.
It’s essential to weigh all variables carefully before committing to any specific plan.
We anticipate more clarity once additional data and feedback have been collected.
This requires careful consideration to align with both short-term and long-term goals.
Our current focus is on understanding the full scope before taking action.
We need to consult with other departments to fully understand their perspectives.
At this point, it’s premature to provide a definitive answer or timeline.
Multiple factors must be considered to ensure a well-rounded approach is taken.
We’re coordinating efforts to ensure alignment across all stakeholders involved in this.
The complexity of this matter means we need additional time to assess properly.
We’re committed to making informed decisions supported by thorough analysis and discussion.
This will likely require several rounds of review before any decisions are finalized.
We’re working to clarify outstanding questions before proceeding with formal recommendations.
It’s important that we maintain flexibility as new information becomes available.
We’re balancing competing priorities to determine the most effective way forward.
Our goal is to minimize risk while maximizing potential benefits for all parties.
We appreciate your understanding as we continue to work through these details.
We intend to update all relevant parties once a clearer path forward is defined.
Ensuring alignment between teams is critical before moving ahead with implementation.
This process will take some time to ensure all perspectives are adequately considered.
We’re continuing to evaluate several possibilities, but we’re not in a position to provide a concrete direction at this time.
That’s currently being reviewed by multiple departments, and we’ll need some time before we can present a consolidated viewpoint on it.
We’ve received initial feedback, but we’re still working through the details before we can make any sort of final decision.
At this stage, it’s really about understanding the broader context before we commit to anything too specific or binding.
There are still a number of unknowns we’re trying to clarify before we determine the most effective way to move forward.
We’re not ready to comment officially yet, as the matter is still under active discussion across several working groups internally.
That’s certainly on our radar, but there are some complexities we need to sort out before we can move ahead.
We’ve had several conversations about that internally, but no clear consensus has been reached at this point in time.
It’s a valid concern, and one that we’ll need to explore in much greater detail before taking any firm stance.
While there are some promising early signals, it’s still too soon to draw any meaningful conclusions from what we’ve seen.
We want to ensure we’re not making premature assumptions, so we're holding off on decisions until more clarity is available.
We do plan to address that, but the timing really depends on how other priorities evolve in the coming weeks.
We’re still in the process of identifying the key stakeholders who should be involved in the decision-making process for this.
That’s something we’re looking at closely, but we haven’t completed the necessary due diligence to move it forward responsibly.
We appreciate the suggestion, and it’s something we’ll take back to the team for further consideration and prioritization.
We’re aware of the situation and fully intend to follow up once we’ve completed a more thorough internal review.
We’re factoring in several external considerations that could impact how we eventually choose to approach this initiative going forward.
Although we’ve discussed this in previous meetings, we haven’t yet resolved some critical questions that are still outstanding.
We’ll need alignment from leadership before we can provide any official update or next steps on that particular issue.
That’s something we’ve been tracking for a while, and we’ll escalate it when the timing is more appropriate.
It’s definitely part of our long-term vision, but we don’t have a concrete timeline for implementation just yet.
We’ve acknowledged the concern and are actively working on a path that aligns with our broader strategic priorities.
That’s being taken under advisement as we continue to gather relevant input from both internal and external partners.
This requires a coordinated approach across several teams, which is why it’s taking longer than initially anticipated.
Rest assured, it’s not being ignored — we’re just working through several blockers that are currently slowing progress.
I mean, it’s something we should definitely keep in mind, but I think we need to get more context before deciding.
Actually, we could go ahead with it, but I think we need to gather more input from other departments first.
Well, it’s a good idea, but we really need to ensure we have all the necessary information before moving forward with it.
Um, that sounds promising, but we might want to spend some more time thinking through the potential outcomes before proceeding.
I think it’s worth considering, but we should definitely revisit this after we get some additional data to support our decision-making process.
Actually, I think it’s a good point, but let’s circle back to it after we get more clarity from the team.
Well, that’s something we could consider, but it’s important we review all aspects of it before making any final decisions.
Actually, I think we might need to do a bit more research before we move forward with that idea.
Well, we should probably look into that further, but we need to weigh all the possible options first to make a solid decision.
Um, that’s a valid consideration, but let’s make sure we have all the facts and data available before finalizing anything.
I think it’s a good suggestion, but we should definitely take some time to analyze all possible consequences before moving forward with it.
Actually, it could work, but I think we need to consult with a few more stakeholders before we proceed.
Well, we could go with that approach, but we should get more feedback from the team to ensure it aligns with our overall strategy.
Um, it’s definitely worth exploring, but we should consider all the potential risks involved before committing to this course of action.
Actually, it’s something we could try, but I think we need to review the numbers and data before making any decisions.
Well, that might be an option, but let’s give it some more thought and check with other teams before moving ahead.
Actually, it’s worth looking into, but we should ensure we’ve reviewed all the factors that might affect its success.
Well, I think we need to evaluate the pros and cons a bit more thoroughly before we commit to anything.

Um, I think we should spend some more time evaluating the feasibility of this option before making any decisions on it.
Well, it could be a good idea, but we might need to refine it a bit before proceeding.
Actually, I think we should try to gather more perspectives before moving forward, just to ensure we’re making the best choice.
Well, it sounds like a great idea, but we need to make sure it fits into the bigger picture before we move ahead with it.
Actually, I think it’s something we could consider, but we need to check if it’s aligned with our long-term goals first.
Well, we could definitely explore this, but we should make sure we have a solid plan in place before proceeding with it.
Um, it’s definitely a good starting point, but I think we need to dive deeper into the details before moving forward with it.
Well, that sounds like a great approach, but we should evaluate it more thoroughly to avoid any unforeseen issues down the line.
Actually, I think we should take a little more time to review this before making a final call, just to ensure we’re making the right decision.
Well, we could give that a shot, but I think we need to analyze the potential challenges before going all in.
Actually, it’s something we could try, but let’s make sure we have a plan in place for how to handle any unexpected outcomes.
Well, I think it’s worth exploring, but we should assess the possible risks first to ensure it’s a viable solution.

Well, we could explore that option, but I think we need to gather more input before we make a solid decision.
Actually, it’s something we could think about, but let’s make sure we have the right resources in place before going ahead with it.
Um, that could work, but I think we should take a step back and review all the factors involved before proceeding.
Actually, let’s take a moment to think this over and then come back to it with fresh perspectives.
Well, I think we should evaluate the situation more carefully before taking any further steps to ensure we’re on the right track.
Actually, it could be a good option, but let’s give it some more thought and take our time with the decision.
Well, we could consider that, but I think we should take some time to review other alternatives before committing to anything.
Actually, I think it’s a great idea, but we should definitely make sure we have the necessary resources to support it before we move forward.
Um, we could definitely give it a try, but I think we need to be mindful of how it aligns with our current goals and priorities.
Well, that sounds promising, but we need to take a closer look at how it impacts our overall strategy.
Actually, I think it’s something we need to think about in greater detail before deciding whether to proceed or not.
Well, we should definitely take some time to carefully review all aspects of it before making any commitments.
Actually, we could give that a try, but let’s ensure we’ve covered all the details first.
Well, it’s something to consider, but let’s take a step back and make sure we’re looking at it from all angles.
