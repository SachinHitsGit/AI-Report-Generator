      "-  We're ready to record.\n",
      "- So commit, boost duty.\n",
      "- Simon, thank you for I saw you already posted on the thing and branded too.\n",
      "- And so Parker, if you could grab a slot on the scheduled air and Alita will need some slots as well so we can cover that.\n",
      "- And then Core Max and I recuse the three of us from commit, boost duty, given the other scope of stage architect stuff.\n",
      "- Now I'm going to try to do last year.\n",
      "- I did the entire 24 hour live chat when that was a mistake.\n",
      "- But I'm going to try to be in there for as many chats as possible because I don't think I think there are.\n",
      "- I know of some cases where the speakers won't be able to make it.\n",
      "- Or be sure there's someone in there to answer the chat questions.\n",
      "- Yeah, I'm doing the same thing.\n",
      "- At you know, this is this is one of those things where like we we knew this.\n",
      "- This is but we didn't account for it.\n",
      "- So cover, you know, cover commit chat for A-pack hours.\n",
      "- That is an agenda item we should add to our architect sync.\n",
      "- And we're like right up on the heels of it.\n",
      "- So I don't know if there's I don't know who we can get to sync that time.\n",
      "- But let's add that.\n",
      "- I would try, you know, in some cases, it could be the speaker could cover it.\n",
      "- And the other case is depending upon their time zone.\n",
      "- And the other case, you know, we could probably get an essay or a PM that's in a good time zone for it to cover.\n",
      "- I remember doing that last time.\n",
      "- And I remember there being a scramble around it.\n",
      "- And there's just no like these are all the things we need to do for commit.\n",
      "- Like that's a thing we need to do.\n",
      "- But it's not on a checklist anywhere.\n",
      "- It's a handover.\n",
      "- So Q3 OKRs.\n",
      "- So let's let's chat a little bit about some of these things.\n",
      "- I'm going to share my screen here.\n",
      "- So what I'm pretty excited about is we are marching towards doing this in a more organized fashion that, you know, I don't I don't think we've had this this level of rigor.\n",
      "- And we should be looking to do more rigor as we.\n",
      "- We've on so I had a link here.\n",
      "- These are CIDs OKRs, which are a GitLab managed future conversion from free and even prouder to work here.\n",
      "- So what's nice then is Craig's OKRs roll up to that.\n",
      "- So Craig's OKRs are increased funnel and drive pipeline elevate marketing messaging positioning and maintain high team member delight through strong prioritization and collaboration.\n",
      "- So what's nice is these are rolling up.\n",
      "- So then when you get and then I link to Craig's OKR deck here.\n",
      "- If you want to poke into that, there's there's more info there.\n",
      "- So when you start to look at our OKRs, they roll up to those you know they ours are really roll up to harsh harsh roll up to Craig's, Craig's roll up to CID.\n",
      "- And hey, alignment.\n",
      "- So that is exciting because in an ideal world, the the projects that we are planning aligned to the strategic goals.\n",
      "- So in some ways, this doc is still in draft.\n",
      "- So for example, I need to get I have a call Ryan this week.\n",
      "- I want to get like a full list of what can we expect for RFIs and reports so we can plan that bandwidth, right?\n",
      "- Similarly, there are things on here like our corporate event support.\n",
      "- I think these ones we've are well documented, which ones we're covering, the field marketing events.\n",
      "- So ideally, what we're doing here and I see that some folks have already kind of started to chime in and been like, yeah, I can pick up this one.\n",
      "- What I want to what I basically want to avoid is I want to avoid like, you know, Cindy has like eight webinars this quarter.\n",
      "- And like I have to or you know, that kind of like imbalance.\n",
      "- So between field events, demand gen webinars, partner webinars and ABM webinars.\n",
      "- Like I want to make sure that we kind of balance out that load.\n",
      "- It's kind of what I'm aiming for here.\n",
      "- Here we have a list.\n",
      "- And then it has a link here.\n",
      "- And this is the list of proposed field events.\n",
      "- So we did this last quarter and got I think eight.\n",
      "- This quarter we got 18.\n",
      "- That gives me a little bit more confidence that we're more a little bit more comprehensive.\n",
      "- So I have an action item to go through these and try to I might pop them in a spreadsheet or something so that we can look at like how many is partner doing?\n",
      "- How many is core Mac doing, you know, any any questions on just the webinars for the quarter?\n",
      "- So you want us to put in what we are signed up to or you want us or you're putting them in based upon the request.\n",
      "- So ideally we kind of like batch process these.\n",
      "- What I'd like to do if I ever get like five minutes of extra time that I'm not, you know, just jammed with stuff.\n",
      "- Commit commit is taking like a meaningful amounts of my time.\n",
      "- But in an ideal world.\n",
      "- This list here.\n",
      "- Like what do I want?\n",
      "- And in some ways this is nice because this is, you know, all in issues.\n",
      "- So, but it's kind of makes it cumbersome to filter.\n",
      "- So ideally what I could do is I could look at this and I could say like, are these evenly distributed across the team?\n",
      "- Because everyone on the team, are they picking up a few, right?\n",
      "- Rather than like one person being loaded with a ton.\n",
      "- And are they like, you know, is field marketing asking Parker to deliver like five events the same week that, you know, major project plan is due for release marketing or something like that, right?\n",
      "- You might think we can manage this by like we could sign up.\n",
      "- We could look at the list and assign ourselves to the ones that we think are appropriate.\n",
      "- And we can self manage if we've got too many in one week or big conflicts.\n",
      "- We can say, Hey, I can't do this.\n",
      "- Can somebody else do this?\n",
      "- Yeah, that's a good, that's a good call.\n",
      "- There's I don't the managing conflicts versus your projects is I think good.\n",
      "- We need some type of all team collaboration.\n",
      "- We need, we need some way.\n",
      "- So for example, like I looked at the ones from last week.\n",
      "- I don't think everybody put them in there.\n",
      "- Wherever we had.\n",
      "- So Brian had none.\n",
      "- I don't know.\n",
      "- One, two, three, four, five.\n",
      "- I have a list there.\n",
      "- But I wouldn't want you to look at that and go, you have too many.\n",
      "- You need to farm some of those out because sometimes I'm able to reuse content from one to the other.\n",
      "- Some, they're all DevSecOps topics.\n",
      "- Some of it was on, I was the spokesperson for the DevSecOps survey.\n",
      "- So a bunch of them came from that.\n",
      "- And honestly, I just tend to have more of those and of the customer meetings than other people.\n",
      "- And maybe I have less of something else.\n",
      "- I don't, I feel like it's a little bit artificial to feel like you've got to distribute it for us.\n",
      "- I have a list somewhere I'll be putting it in.\n",
      "- I think it was fun.\n",
      "- So what we, what we need to do though is, so we need to make sure that for all of these projects that we're signing up for.\n",
      "- And a lot of them are like horizontal.\n",
      "- So for example, like launch plan development, right?\n",
      "- Like, this is a new, you know, a new practice that we haven't really done before.\n",
      "- So we'll need to look as a team what launches are coming up even.\n",
      "- And we just need to make sure that our kind of our priorities are in sync and that we have coverage across.\n",
      "- So I'm not necessarily saying like, we need to kind of artificially flow it.\n",
      "- And I definitely don't necessarily want to like, dull out like you're doing this one, you're doing this one.\n",
      "- But I do want to make sure that there's some spread across the team, right?\n",
      "- Oh, I do want to make sure that like, everyone's at least doing some events.\n",
      "- And I do want to make sure that we cover them.\n",
      "- And I do want to make sure that we, you know, are getting to our other kind of priorities and content generation.\n",
      "- So those are, that's kind of like the, we got to get some kind of wrangle on this.\n",
      "- And then frankly, I like, I personally lost a meaningful, significant chunk of the chunk of my time last quarter due to field last minute asking me for stuff.\n",
      "- And I had to shift things around and I had to like chat with FMM managers and like, I don't have time for that this quarter.\n",
      "- So like the last quarter we did like, everybody just grab events and I prefer that.\n",
      "- I like, I prefer decentralized, but like, I cannot commit the time this quarter to like, I fell through the cracks and what do we miss?\n",
      "- So I need to be injected somewhere in there to say like, look, we have a plan that I feel good about.\n",
      "- And like, my time won't be sucked some point at the future.\n",
      "- Is that kind of fair?\n",
      "- But I think, I think if you tell us what, what, you know, you've told us the objectives, I think we can sign up, manage ourselves and.\n",
      "- Like, let's, let's do this then.\n",
      "- We just, we need them to all be covered and we need them to not.\n",
      "- So, so what we also need to do too is across these 18 events, like some of these are for PMM and some of these are for PMM.\n",
      "- So that's, that's all it just, it just needs to be managed like, I am not comfortable saying like, go and sign up for stuff and then I'll just see what doesn't get signed up for.\n",
      "- Why not?\n",
      "- Because that didn't work last quarter and it was extremely painful.\n",
      "- What didn't, what part of it didn't work?\n",
      "- We didn't sign up like we were supposed to or they didn't give us the full list and advance like they were supposed to.\n",
      "- I think that the full list wasn't there.\n",
      "- That's a, that's a good question.\n",
      "- What were the kind of problems?\n",
      "- What are we trying to optimize for?\n",
      "- Like, we're, I'm going to do this.\n",
      "- I'm going to review all of the items.\n",
      "- That's what we're going to do.\n",
      "- So if there are ones that you want to sign up for, go ahead and comment in there.\n",
      "- This will be part of the process this quarter.\n",
      "- Instead of commenting, if we assign it, then you could, you could do a board or a filter for which ones are not assigned or, you know, which ones are assigned to, to each of us.\n",
      "- I'm just a thought.\n",
      "- Well, there's problems with that too though.\n",
      "- Like, like some of these are already assigned to people, some are assigned to multiple people.\n",
      "- Like they're not, they're not consistent.\n",
      "- So like we need a consistent view.\n",
      "- I have a quick question on that.\n",
      "- So are we, are we going to take up all the field marketing events or are we going to prioritize based on the OKR that we have actually set for ourselves, which is, I think, pipeline, pipeline generator?\n",
      "- So, in your contribution, I think, is the metric.\n",
      "- Well, so there's two, there's two elements here.\n",
      "- And we got to, we should chat in a moment about KPIs.\n",
      "- So KPIs are going to be different than OKRs, but they are related.\n",
      "- So here, the, the OKR, the key result for this objective is to increase funnel velocity and drive pipeline.\n",
      "- So yes, by the, as we look at these events, if we can't pick up all of them, then ideally, we're asking questions like, like, which one of these, what's the revenue potential.\n",
      "- And we make sure that we pick up the ones that are the most.\n",
      "- Like we're prioritizing, we're prioritizing based on the key result we're aiming for.\n",
      "- And so, you know, we're doing this for the case of the CODA, we're doing this for the case of the CODA, particularly.\n",
      "- I don't know that we're to that level of sophistication yet.\n",
      "- Like I said, this is like a step of maturity up from what we did last quarter, but eventually, like, ideally what we would have is for these KRs, we would say, we're doing this and we expect this out of it.\n",
      "- Certainly on any of these that that is the lens to look through is like hey for this we're trying to drive pipeline.\n",
      "- So we're trying to get these finalize one else.\n",
      "- Okay, so one other element to this is.\n",
      "- This is the OKR epic.\n",
      "- So this has Craig's three OKRs.\n",
      "- And then if you drill into one of these epics, for example, like you know increase pipeline that we were just looking at.\n",
      "- This does have some specific results like, you know, web direct purchases.\n",
      "- That's super interesting there.\n",
      "- And that's on dunks looking for web direct for first order.\n",
      "- So I just anyway, I just noticed that.\n",
      "- But here's an example of like product marketing reposition free product individuals and paid product to business.\n",
      "- Honestly, I'm like just double clicking at this now because I'm trying to think like how does this align to this.\n",
      "- I'm also wondering if that is that public.\n",
      "- No, yeah, it's not confidential.\n",
      "- Yeah, these are all public.\n",
      "- I think this was this was one of the ideas that Craig had for the pricing page AB test where he said that our message on the free should say for individual users and for the paid to say for business users or enterprise users or something like that.\n",
      "- So that's enough pricing page backlog.\n",
      "- But I don't know if he had something else in mind as well.\n",
      "- So that we we might need to add something here that aligns to that.\n",
      "- Honestly, we didn't like you can see in our doc.\n",
      "- We went from like Craig's to the teams.\n",
      "- So we didn't go to that level.\n",
      "- The one that I know about is.\n",
      "- For example, here.\n",
      "- In this messaging and positioning.\n",
      "- We have.\n",
      "- This golden pitch, right.\n",
      "- So this is something that.\n",
      "- Core Mac is leading up, which is like.\n",
      "- Golden pitch certification.\n",
      "- And honestly, some of this also needs to be.\n",
      "- Rethought now we were going to run this at contribute.\n",
      "- So maybe we, I don't know if there's a still on the docket and we run it at.\n",
      "- You know, a sink will probably actually this is a good agenda item for a call later today, Core Mac.\n",
      "- The reason I want to point this out to the rest of the team is this comes from Craig.\n",
      "- And then Craig has one that cascades down to harsh.\n",
      "- Harsh will probably just like it cascades right down to me.\n",
      "- And then it cascades right down.\n",
      "- So Core Mac will be the a sign here.\n",
      "- Like this will literally be.\n",
      "- Core Mac is leading this project.\n",
      "- Ideally for each of these things, we have.\n",
      "- An okay R issue in this marketing planning.\n",
      "- Project.\n",
      "- And that's on my like Tracy's already logged all of her.\n",
      "- So this is like a to do for me to do.\n",
      "- The reason I want to bring it up to the team now is because it means we'll have some duplication.\n",
      "- And then you know, if you're working on your stuff and you can, you can organize it and structure it.\n",
      "- And then, you know, if it's an okay R, there'll be like some accompanying okay R issue.\n",
      "- And what I don't want to do is I don't want to impose the constraint.\n",
      "- Like you must work your project out of this marketing planning project.\n",
      "- I think that'll cause all kinds of mess.\n",
      "- And then, you know, the way to roll it is, they'll just be, they'll be some duplication.\n",
      "- So in some cases, like I might have an issue.\n",
      "- And you might have some projects that are under that issue.\n",
      "- In some cases, like you might, you yourself might be assigned to that.\n",
      "- Any kind of questions on just this, the okay R sort of planning the way they're trying to roll it up.\n",
      "- So KPIs.\n",
      "- So we had a solid discussion on this last time.\n",
      "- And we've iterated here.\n",
      "- This has been reviewed with Craig.\n",
      "- And so the idea here with okay R's, those are quarterly, right?\n",
      "- The KPIs are intended to be like longer term.\n",
      "- So we're like our okay, our CB driving our KPIs, they should be related.\n",
      "- But one is a femoral and one is, you know, intended to be like longer.\n",
      "- Like we're, we're tracking these things as a team overtime.\n",
      "- So some attributes of this.\n",
      "- You know, perk on a Samuist comments last week.\n",
      "- And Craig wanted this as well and harsh to and I. I'm going to say that.\n",
      "- I'm going to say that.\n",
      "- I've been sold by the team.\n",
      "- That we want more of a direct line.\n",
      "- So as an example, if we say okay, well, we're delivering web content.\n",
      "- So we're going to be responsible for something like, you know, inquiries on the website.\n",
      "- If we're just responsible for the total inquiries number and we share that with say Danielle's team.\n",
      "- So that's what we're going to do.\n",
      "- So we're going to be doing a team that's going to be like who's actually responsible.\n",
      "- Is it us or Danielle?\n",
      "- And then be like, we don't contribute to all the inquiries.\n",
      "- That doesn't really make sense.\n",
      "- The idea is that we as a team should be incentivized to make them successful.\n",
      "- Like we as a team work horizontally across teams and marketing.\n",
      "- So that's why you see like alignment with Danielle's team, alignment with Dunks team, alignment with Evans team.\n",
      "- So that's the horizontal and then here is the the ideally we're trying to tie it more of a straight lines of the work we do.\n",
      "- So quite frankly, I don't know how we're going to instrument for this.\n",
      "- We start to get back into some of the some of the goofiness we have in the past.\n",
      "- I think there's a few guardrails here.\n",
      "- So one is I don't want to track views for like all content ever where we have some complicated matrix and we're trying to like track down every YouTube video and all of this kind of goofiness.\n",
      "- Like we should just have a web dashboard that is like this is the web content that we put out and we can track things like page use and about to rate.\n",
      "- I think this is great.\n",
      "- It's a move in the right direction.\n",
      "- I think page views is still a little bit goofy because like like we discussed previously as well, we.\n",
      "- We don't have control on how people are going to land on this page.\n",
      "- Yes, we can do a little bit of SEO, but if the solution is not let's say at the top of the.\n",
      "- On our homepage header, then nobody's going to be able to find a particular page.\n",
      "- I think that goes back to the question on whether we need that page at all or not and whether we should invest our time on that I think bounce rate is a better metric on the content itself.\n",
      "- Because it shows that if a customer is not engaged on that content, then they would move bounce rate is one and time on page is is the other metric that we could look at rather than having page views that's not.\n",
      "- So we we need to track if the content is valuable, for example, from an essay, a perspective, if if people are searching and landing on that page.\n",
      "- And if a page is valuable in a customer journey, we need to be incentivized as a team to collaborate with the rest of marketing to get it into that flow.\n",
      "- So what metric would you propose to incentivize those things?\n",
      "- So if it's about collaboration and working on the journey, then page views is a good metric, right, because then we need to think about it from a customer's point of view, customer lands on the front page, then wants to say let's say wants to know more about CIC or get offs right how do they land on that page today for example get offs they cannot land on directly unless they land directly on that page through an SEO search right.\n",
      "- Because it's not part of the top header solution header that we have on our homepage and we don't expose the solution tab anymore on our homepage other than at the footer of the page right and there are many, many such pages like that we don't have one specifically for continuous delivery as an example.\n",
      "- So if we have to work with the extended team to get that in place, then we need an overall information architecture like we spoke about right like how do we, what's the journey that the customer needs to take and what use cases that we want to showcase to the customer and only those are things that we should as a team pick up and work on rather than putting together 10 different pages.\n",
      "- Like we spoke about this team pages for for pricing themes there's no way that a customer can land on those pages except through SEO right we wouldn't link to that from the pricing page we wouldn't link to it from the main page either so that's mostly going to be just an SEO effort.\n",
      "- Right so the, essentially we want to have a decision matrix like I'm going to have page A or page B which one should I invest time in should I generate a new page or should I refresh an existing page like overall views is something that like page views on PMM page content is something that we want to track.\n",
      "- The other end of this to and Craig was like really open to this was ideally these are long term and then we're trying we're tracking trends over time but given that our KPIs have been so goofy and ridiculous for a year plus we just need to try something right so we need to measure and get some baselines and maybe there is a better metric or we iterate next quarter.\n",
      "- But this is kind of like a quantity and a quality metric so we want to look at both of those we both want to get like and then I again it's like the idea here is like if we generate more top of funnel volume in this case we're measuring that by page views but that the assumption there is that it's a leading metric to feed things like inquiries and self service.\n",
      "- Right so that's what we also want to track not just so we want to track that like this is a page and this page individually performs well like when people land on it they don't bounce but we also need some type of measure that we are contributing to the downstream thing which is the inquiries in the in the self service signups which page views would also get to that so.\n",
      "- So similarly here for demand gen content.\n",
      "- I don't know again I don't know how we're going to instrument for this it is i'll tell you what it will not be is it this will not be us architecting our own separate machine like for all of these like whatever we measure like this measure like these measures need to come through Google analytics like through the whatever the web normative.\n",
      "- The most important thing is like our measurement for our kpi can't be like what we need some other tool to do that we have to like work within the.\n",
      "- The confines of what we're measuring so it's the same thing for demand gen right like demand gen has this.\n",
      "- Dashboard which I wonder if I can like pull it quickly actually I probably can't show in a public video but you know they're already tracking things they're tracking things like inquiries and essayos and mqls and they track linear attribution so so that's already a metric that's being tracked we just need to segment out the PMM content.\n",
      "- So in theory here and this should be like everything that drives a pipeline like if it's in.\n",
      "- Path factory and it's PMM contributed like we should be able to pull a number out of that I don't know how we're going to instrument for that i'm open to ideas.\n",
      "- This one should be a lot easier.\n",
      "- Essentially like a while back to y'all remember we had this thing and there was like five levels of like you know did you write the content did you review the content did you all like it was really really goofy and then we like had this extra job of going and like coding all of that.\n",
      "- So we need to avoid that like as much as possible when we measure stuff it should be like a normal part of the process like we went and did this work and then like there's not some meaningful significant extra task to go and measure it so for field.\n",
      "- Events they already track the linear attribution it's already part of the Salesforce object so this should be a simple as as like looking at you know this this list of events and saying like these were the events for the quarter we know what the list is let's go pull the linear attribution these ones are like PMM contributed events.\n",
      "- So that's kind of the the thought there any any kind of other thoughts on on KPIs.\n",
      "- Measurement.\n",
      "- Yeah this might be a little down in the weeds but eventually are we going to get to the point where we are.\n",
      "- Like how we attach ourselves to that is going to be interesting to figure out like are we 10% of that are we 20% of that are we competing with other groups for that like what is our.\n",
      "- Because you know we could we could contribute to something it's hugely valuable for the company but how much time is still worth putting into that if we're going to budget the needle 5% versus 60% and something that's ultimately less value for the company but we might actually be generating more value.\n",
      "- Is there a part of that smaller hole.\n",
      "- So there for instance that kind of comes in mind.\n",
      "- Yeah so feel a reinvent maybe we put in 50 hours for reinvent and reinvent hugely successful but there are a zillion other people working on that as well and like how do we determine how much impact our participation had and that versus the other folks and then judge.\n",
      "- Yeah so that that is not a KPI that's that's on here now corporate it's a corporate events is not on there that's a great call I don't like this is not comprehensive right this is like a stab at.\n",
      "- Incentivizing meaningful things that will move the needle right so we know that this team is team of subject matter experts this team knows the customer knows the product knows the market like no one else can generate the quality and type of content that we can for the web for demand generation or for field.\n",
      "- So and we know that when we do that we know when we put stuff up on the web like it drives outcomes for the business we know that when we do field events it drives outcomes for the business and that's why those are on the OK ours as well so this is like kind of picking the low hanging fruit of like we know this does drive business outcomes that's why we want to track it.\n",
      "- Yeah for something like a you know commit.\n",
      "- You know we're putting amazing amounts of time in the commit how do we get credit for that as a PMM team i'm not i don't know yet.\n",
      "- Right well yeah and how do we know like part of it's getting credit is part of it is just knowing where to spend our time if we can if we can double if we can double the value of something that's worth a third as much versus increasing it 5% you know somewhere else.\n",
      "- Yeah so i've to have two bits of guidance on that right so.\n",
      "- um well let's think of do that for the most so I would say one if if there is some project something that you believe if I invest my time and think acts it will meaning fully move this needle like to your point is like this could this could like increases by 50% not just 5% Like that should be easy to justify even if it's not like a specific KPI and maybe let's like have a conversation about it right like let's bring that maybe the whole team should be doing that thing whatever that is right so like if you see that thing and you're like I can have big impact here.\n",
      "- That should be like the overarching decision matrix right like as you're looking at like all the stuff you spend your time on like what's driving meaningful goals um.\n",
      "- The other one is like we got to keep the lights on right or what we call like business like businesses usual so like this doesn't track like sales enablements this doesn't track.\n",
      "- messaging and positioning really like it's oh it's okay our for us but we're not like you know we don't have like a KPI that's like how many people used our messaging like there's things that we need to do as a team that's that's.\n",
      "- We're probably not ever going to be able to track but they're important things to do.\n",
      "- Right and yeah i'm just curious I know you're in some product marketing.\n",
      "- Association or something do they have like a library of things that they share where you could see examples of what other people do they do so.\n",
      "- The the challenge is is how so i've looked i looked at all of that as well and they do actually there's a pts they put out if I can if I can track down the pdf i'll share that with a group.\n",
      "- The nutshell of it is that pmm works really differently in different places right so in in other orgs product marketing owns campaigns they don't have like there is no Jackie's team like this team is Jackie's team and like this team has an mql number that they need to hit.\n",
      "- But like that doesn't make sense for us because like we're not the campaigns team.\n",
      "- In in other orgs product marketing might even own like a revenue number right like when I was at Twilio like every product team function pretty much autonomously like the PM was a little CEO and the PMM was a little CMO.\n",
      "- And we were responsible for our business like we had a weekly meeting where we had like this is the revenue that our product is generating and the marketing plan had to contribute to driving revenue for the product.\n",
      "- But we don't work that way right so in in.\n",
      "- Like the things that other so these are metrics that have come from other so there are things like other PMM orgs they track their web content performance.\n",
      "- Um they track their webinar content performance right they track like the demand gen content that PMM generates those are those are things that other orgs do.\n",
      "- Um some of those other metrics though are like don't make sense for us.\n",
      "- Is bounce rate set and so do we know like what pages that focuses on I've always been a little iffy on bounce rate in general right because if it's a page if the intent is to have multiple views.\n",
      "- If you if the intent is to go to multiple pages or multiple views and a high bounce rate is good right.\n",
      "- No no no so bounce bounce rate measures like.\n",
      "- If somebody lands on the page and that contents like not meaningful to them.\n",
      "- Like because you have bounce rate and you have exit rate right.\n",
      "- So this is the page bounce rate.\n",
      "- All right so we want people to.\n",
      "- You want to know about.\n",
      "- On the page in because if we want people to view.\n",
      "- If the success of the page we're talking about depends on people going to more than one page than a high bounce rate is bad.\n",
      "- So we want people to go through a journey and go to multiple places bounce rate would be like I came to this page and I backed out of it.\n",
      "- Right if they come if they come to a page and they're like this is the next step of my journey and then they go to that next page that's good.\n",
      "- Okay all right so but you know the okay there's just some pages where bounce rate wouldn't make sense right because we don't want them to go anywhere else.\n",
      "- No no no no let's let's you and I sink on on what bounce rate is because it's it's a little more nuanced than that.\n",
      "- Okay um I will share with the team that another potential metric here might be like click through rate.\n",
      "- So the idea would be if we identified on every one of our pages what's the next step which might be go to another page or it might be fill out a lead cap.\n",
      "- Or like there might be some action.\n",
      "- And then we would measure that action like was the action taken the reason I don't want to do that this quarter is because we're not instrumented for it.\n",
      "- Yeah as I started to instantly attempt them right or you know a lot of time to show you like a symptomatic.\n",
      "- Piece of a journey as opposed to being indicative of value but yeah well we're just we don't have the measurement for it so Google Analytics can do that but we don't have the trackers on the page to measure.\n",
      "- Okay okay so this stuff we can measure today we'll do that for this quarter and maybe in the future we we get more granular with more specific.\n",
      "- Um this is cool uh sales QBRs uh are optional.\n",
      "- Um this uh this quarter we probably should chat about um what kind of async review we would want to commit to or we need to think about this if anybody has a has a proposal.\n",
      "- I value like a proposal like I think the team should do this and then the an idea here is kind of if you think about it in like an 80 20.\n",
      "- So like you want to get like you want to do enough research that you understand something and then you want to generate like more content out of that thing.\n",
      "- So ideally like we're not like you know diving 50 layers deep into like customer stuff we're just like we understand the customer we know the customer the customer expert.\n",
      "- Okay now let's go use that information and and drive our all of our other content we need to generate.\n",
      "- So uh thank you for the time team uh let's catch up async on some of these other threads that are still going on.\n",
      "- Cool everybody happy Monday thank you see ya.\n",

      " We're ready to record. So commit, boost duty. Simon, thank you for I saw you already posted on the thing and branded too. And so Parker, if you could grab a slot on the scheduled air and Alita will need some slots as well so we can cover that. And then Core Max and I recuse the three of us from commit, boost duty, given the other scope of stage architect stuff. Now I'm going to try to do last year. I did the entire 24 hour live chat when that was a mistake. But I'm going to try to be in there for as many chats as possible because I don't think I think there are. I know of some cases where the speakers won't be able to make it. Or be sure there's someone in there to answer the chat questions. Yeah, I'm doing the same thing. At you know, this is this is one of those things where like we we knew this. This is but we didn't account for it. So cover, you know, cover commit chat for A-pack hours. That is an agenda item we should add to our architect sync. And we're like right up on the heels of it. So I don't know if there's I don't know who we can get to sync that time. But let's add that. I would try, you know, in some cases, it could be the speaker could cover it. And the other case is depending upon their time zone. And the other case, you know, we could probably get an essay or a PM that's in a good time zone for it to cover. I remember doing that last time. And I remember there being a scramble around it. And there's just no like these are all the things we need to do for commit. Like that's a thing we need to do. But it's not on a checklist anywhere. It's a handover. So Q3 OKRs. So let's let's chat a little bit about some of these things. I'm going to share my screen here. So what I'm pretty excited about is we are marching towards doing this in a more organized fashion that, you know, I don't I don't think we've had this this level of rigor. And we should be looking to do more rigor as we. We've on so I had a link here. These are CIDs OKRs, which are a GitLab managed future conversion from free and even prouder to work here. So what's nice then is Craig's OKRs roll up to that. So Craig's OKRs are increased funnel and drive pipeline elevate marketing messaging positioning and maintain high team member delight through strong prioritization and collaboration. So what's nice is these are rolling up. So then when you get and then I link to Craig's OKR deck here. If you want to poke into that, there's there's more info there. So when you start to look at our OKRs, they roll up to those you know they ours are really roll up to harsh harsh roll up to Craig's, Craig's roll up to CID. And hey, alignment. So that is exciting because in an ideal world, the the projects that we are planning aligned to the strategic goals. So in some ways, this doc is still in draft. So for example, I need to get I have a call Ryan this week. I want to get like a full list of what can we expect for RFIs and reports so we can plan that bandwidth, right? Similarly, there are things on here like our corporate event support. I think these ones we've are well documented, which ones we're covering, the field marketing events. So ideally, what we're doing here and I see that some folks have already kind of started to chime in and been like, yeah, I can pick up this one. What I want to what I basically want to avoid is I want to avoid like, you know, Cindy has like eight webinars this quarter. And like I have to or you know, that kind of like imbalance. So between field events, demand gen webinars, partner webinars and ABM webinars. Like I want to make sure that we kind of balance out that load. It's kind of what I'm aiming for here. Here we have a list. And then it has a link here. And this is the list of proposed field events. So we did this last quarter and got I think eight. This quarter we got 18. That gives me a little bit more confidence that we're more a little bit more comprehensive. So I have an action item to go through these and try to I might pop them in a spreadsheet or something so that we can look at like how many is partner doing? How many is core Mac doing, you know, any any questions on just the webinars for the quarter? So you want us to put in what we are signed up to or you want us or you're putting them in based upon the request. So ideally we kind of like batch process these. What I'd like to do if I ever get like five minutes of extra time that I'm not, you know, just jammed with stuff. Commit commit is taking like a meaningful amounts of my time. But in an ideal world. This list here. Like what do I want? And in some ways this is nice because this is, you know, all in issues. So, but it's kind of makes it cumbersome to filter. So ideally what I could do is I could look at this and I could say like, are these evenly distributed across the team? Because everyone on the team, are they picking up a few, right? Rather than like one person being loaded with a ton. And are they like, you know, is field marketing asking Parker to deliver like five events the same week that, you know, major project plan is due for release marketing or something like that, right? You might think we can manage this by like we could sign up. We could look at the list and assign ourselves to the ones that we think are appropriate. And we can self manage if we've got too many in one week or big conflicts. We can say, Hey, I can't do this. Can somebody else do this? Yeah, that's a good, that's a good call. There's I don't the managing conflicts versus your projects is I think good. We need some type of all team collaboration. We need, we need some way. So for example, like I looked at the ones from last week. I don't think everybody put them in there. Wherever we had. So Brian had none. I don't know. One, two, three, four, five. I have a list there. But I wouldn't want you to look at that and go, you have too many. You need to farm some of those out because sometimes I'm able to reuse content from one to the other. Some, they're all DevSecOps topics. Some of it was on, I was the spokesperson for the DevSecOps survey. So a bunch of them came from that. And honestly, I just tend to have more of those and of the customer meetings than other people. And maybe I have less of something else. I don't, I feel like it's a little bit artificial to feel like you've got to distribute it for us. I have a list somewhere I'll be putting it in. I think it was fun. So what we, what we need to do though is, so we need to make sure that for all of these projects that we're signing up for. And a lot of them are like horizontal. So for example, like launch plan development, right? Like, this is a new, you know, a new practice that we haven't really done before. So we'll need to look as a team what launches are coming up even. And we just need to make sure that our kind of our priorities are in sync and that we have coverage across. So I'm not necessarily saying like, we need to kind of artificially flow it. And I definitely don't necessarily want to like, dull out like you're doing this one, you're doing this one. But I do want to make sure that there's some spread across the team, right? Oh, I do want to make sure that like, everyone's at least doing some events. And I do want to make sure that we cover them. And I do want to make sure that we, you know, are getting to our other kind of priorities and content generation. So those are, that's kind of like the, we got to get some kind of wrangle on this. And then frankly, I like, I personally lost a meaningful, significant chunk of the chunk of my time last quarter due to field last minute asking me for stuff. And I had to shift things around and I had to like chat with FMM managers and like, I don't have time for that this quarter. So like the last quarter we did like, everybody just grab events and I prefer that. I like, I prefer decentralized, but like, I cannot commit the time this quarter to like, I fell through the cracks and what do we miss? So I need to be injected somewhere in there to say like, look, we have a plan that I feel good about. And like, my time won't be sucked some point at the future. Is that kind of fair? But I think, I think if you tell us what, what, you know, you've told us the objectives, I think we can sign up, manage ourselves and. Like, let's, let's do this then. We just, we need them to all be covered and we need them to not. So, so what we also need to do too is across these 18 events, like some of these are for PMM and some of these are for PMM. So that's, that's all it just, it just needs to be managed like, I am not comfortable saying like, go and sign up for stuff and then I'll just see what doesn't get signed up for. Why not? Because that didn't work last quarter and it was extremely painful. What didn't, what part of it didn't work? We didn't sign up like we were supposed to or they didn't give us the full list and advance like they were supposed to. I think that the full list wasn't there. That's a, that's a good question. What were the kind of problems? What are we trying to optimize for? Like, we're, I'm going to do this. I'm going to review all of the items. That's what we're going to do. So if there are ones that you want to sign up for, go ahead and comment in there. This will be part of the process this quarter. Instead of commenting, if we assign it, then you could, you could do a board or a filter for which ones are not assigned or, you know, which ones are assigned to, to each of us. I'm just a thought. Well, there's problems with that too though. Like, like some of these are already assigned to people, some are assigned to multiple people. Like they're not, they're not consistent. So like we need a consistent view. I have a quick question on that. So are we, are we going to take up all the field marketing events or are we going to prioritize based on the OKR that we have actually set for ourselves, which is, I think, pipeline, pipeline generator? So, in your contribution, I think, is the metric. Well, so there's two, there's two elements here. And we got to, we should chat in a moment about KPIs. So KPIs are going to be different than OKRs, but they are related. So here, the, the OKR, the key result for this objective is to increase funnel velocity and drive pipeline. So yes, by the, as we look at these events, if we can't pick up all of them, then ideally, we're asking questions like, like, which one of these, what's the revenue potential. And we make sure that we pick up the ones that are the most. Like we're prioritizing, we're prioritizing based on the key result we're aiming for. And so, you know, we're doing this for the case of the CODA, we're doing this for the case of the CODA, particularly. I don't know that we're to that level of sophistication yet. Like I said, this is like a step of maturity up from what we did last quarter, but eventually, like, ideally what we would have is for these KRs, we would say, we're doing this and we expect this out of it. Certainly on any of these that that is the lens to look through is like hey for this we're trying to drive pipeline. So we're trying to get these finalize one else. Okay, so one other element to this is. This is the OKR epic. So this has Craig's three OKRs. And then if you drill into one of these epics, for example, like you know increase pipeline that we were just looking at. This does have some specific results like, you know, web direct purchases. That's super interesting there. And that's on dunks looking for web direct for first order. So I just anyway, I just noticed that. But here's an example of like product marketing reposition free product individuals and paid product to business. Honestly, I'm like just double clicking at this now because I'm trying to think like how does this align to this. I'm also wondering if that is that public. No, yeah, it's not confidential. Yeah, these are all public. I think this was this was one of the ideas that Craig had for the pricing page AB test where he said that our message on the free should say for individual users and for the paid to say for business users or enterprise users or something like that. So that's enough pricing page backlog. But I don't know if he had something else in mind as well. So that we we might need to add something here that aligns to that. Honestly, we didn't like you can see in our doc. We went from like Craig's to the teams. So we didn't go to that level. The one that I know about is. For example, here. In this messaging and positioning. We have. This golden pitch, right. So this is something that. Core Mac is leading up, which is like. Golden pitch certification. And honestly, some of this also needs to be. Rethought now we were going to run this at contribute. So maybe we, I don't know if there's a still on the docket and we run it at. You know, a sink will probably actually this is a good agenda item for a call later today, Core Mac. The reason I want to point this out to the rest of the team is this comes from Craig. And then Craig has one that cascades down to harsh. Harsh will probably just like it cascades right down to me. And then it cascades right down. So Core Mac will be the a sign here. Like this will literally be. Core Mac is leading this project. Ideally for each of these things, we have. An okay R issue in this marketing planning. Project. And that's on my like Tracy's already logged all of her. So this is like a to do for me to do. The reason I want to bring it up to the team now is because it means we'll have some duplication. And then you know, if you're working on your stuff and you can, you can organize it and structure it. And then, you know, if it's an okay R, there'll be like some accompanying okay R issue. And what I don't want to do is I don't want to impose the constraint. Like you must work your project out of this marketing planning project. I think that'll cause all kinds of mess. And then, you know, the way to roll it is, they'll just be, they'll be some duplication. So in some cases, like I might have an issue. And you might have some projects that are under that issue. In some cases, like you might, you yourself might be assigned to that. Any kind of questions on just this, the okay R sort of planning the way they're trying to roll it up. So KPIs. So we had a solid discussion on this last time. And we've iterated here. This has been reviewed with Craig. And so the idea here with okay R's, those are quarterly, right? The KPIs are intended to be like longer term. So we're like our okay, our CB driving our KPIs, they should be related. But one is a femoral and one is, you know, intended to be like longer. Like we're, we're tracking these things as a team overtime. So some attributes of this. You know, perk on a Samuist comments last week. And Craig wanted this as well and harsh to and I. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I've been sold by the team. That we want more of a direct line. So as an example, if we say okay, well, we're delivering web content. So we're going to be responsible for something like, you know, inquiries on the website. If we're just responsible for the total inquiries number and we share that with say Danielle's team. So that's what we're going to do. So we're going to be doing a team that's going to be like who's actually responsible. Is it us or Danielle? And then be like, we don't contribute to all the inquiries. That doesn't really make sense. The idea is that we as a team should be incentivized to make them successful. Like we as a team work horizontally across teams and marketing. So that's why you see like alignment with Danielle's team, alignment with Dunks team, alignment with Evans team. So that's the horizontal and then here is the the ideally we're trying to tie it more of a straight lines of the work we do. So quite frankly, I don't know how we're going to instrument for this. We start to get back into some of the some of the goofiness we have in the past. I think there's a few guardrails here. So one is I don't want to track views for like all content ever where we have some complicated matrix and we're trying to like track down every YouTube video and all of this kind of goofiness. Like we should just have a web dashboard that is like this is the web content that we put out and we can track things like page use and about to rate. I think this is great. It's a move in the right direction. I think page views is still a little bit goofy because like like we discussed previously as well, we. We don't have control on how people are going to land on this page. Yes, we can do a little bit of SEO, but if the solution is not let's say at the top of the. On our homepage header, then nobody's going to be able to find a particular page. I think that goes back to the question on whether we need that page at all or not and whether we should invest our time on that I think bounce rate is a better metric on the content itself. Because it shows that if a customer is not engaged on that content, then they would move bounce rate is one and time on page is is the other metric that we could look at rather than having page views that's not. So we we need to track if the content is valuable, for example, from an essay, a perspective, if if people are searching and landing on that page. And if a page is valuable in a customer journey, we need to be incentivized as a team to collaborate with the rest of marketing to get it into that flow. So what metric would you propose to incentivize those things? So if it's about collaboration and working on the journey, then page views is a good metric, right, because then we need to think about it from a customer's point of view, customer lands on the front page, then wants to say let's say wants to know more about CIC or get offs right how do they land on that page today for example get offs they cannot land on directly unless they land directly on that page through an SEO search right. Because it's not part of the top header solution header that we have on our homepage and we don't expose the solution tab anymore on our homepage other than at the footer of the page right and there are many, many such pages like that we don't have one specifically for continuous delivery as an example. So if we have to work with the extended team to get that in place, then we need an overall information architecture like we spoke about right like how do we, what's the journey that the customer needs to take and what use cases that we want to showcase to the customer and only those are things that we should as a team pick up and work on rather than putting together 10 different pages. Like we spoke about this team pages for for pricing themes there's no way that a customer can land on those pages except through SEO right we wouldn't link to that from the pricing page we wouldn't link to it from the main page either so that's mostly going to be just an SEO effort. Right so the, essentially we want to have a decision matrix like I'm going to have page A or page B which one should I invest time in should I generate a new page or should I refresh an existing page like overall views is something that like page views on PMM page content is something that we want to track. The other end of this to and Craig was like really open to this was ideally these are long term and then we're trying we're tracking trends over time but given that our KPIs have been so goofy and ridiculous for a year plus we just need to try something right so we need to measure and get some baselines and maybe there is a better metric or we iterate next quarter. But this is kind of like a quantity and a quality metric so we want to look at both of those we both want to get like and then I again it's like the idea here is like if we generate more top of funnel volume in this case we're measuring that by page views but that the assumption there is that it's a leading metric to feed things like inquiries and self service. Right so that's what we also want to track not just so we want to track that like this is a page and this page individually performs well like when people land on it they don't bounce but we also need some type of measure that we are contributing to the downstream thing which is the inquiries in the in the self service signups which page views would also get to that so. So similarly here for demand gen content. I don't know again I don't know how we're going to instrument for this it is i'll tell you what it will not be is it this will not be us architecting our own separate machine like for all of these like whatever we measure like this measure like these measures need to come through Google analytics like through the whatever the web normative. The most important thing is like our measurement for our kpi can't be like what we need some other tool to do that we have to like work within the. The confines of what we're measuring so it's the same thing for demand gen right like demand gen has this. Dashboard which I wonder if I can like pull it quickly actually I probably can't show in a public video but you know they're already tracking things they're tracking things like inquiries and essayos and mqls and they track linear attribution so so that's already a metric that's being tracked we just need to segment out the PMM content. So in theory here and this should be like everything that drives a pipeline like if it's in. Path factory and it's PMM contributed like we should be able to pull a number out of that I don't know how we're going to instrument for that i'm open to ideas. This one should be a lot easier. Essentially like a while back to y'all remember we had this thing and there was like five levels of like you know did you write the content did you review the content did you all like it was really really goofy and then we like had this extra job of going and like coding all of that. So we need to avoid that like as much as possible when we measure stuff it should be like a normal part of the process like we went and did this work and then like there's not some meaningful significant extra task to go and measure it so for field. Events they already track the linear attribution it's already part of the Salesforce object so this should be a simple as as like looking at you know this this list of events and saying like these were the events for the quarter we know what the list is let's go pull the linear attribution these ones are like PMM contributed events. So that's kind of the the thought there any any kind of other thoughts on on KPIs. Measurement. Yeah this might be a little down in the weeds but eventually are we going to get to the point where we are. Like how we attach ourselves to that is going to be interesting to figure out like are we 10% of that are we 20% of that are we competing with other groups for that like what is our. Because you know we could we could contribute to something it's hugely valuable for the company but how much time is still worth putting into that if we're going to budget the needle 5% versus 60% and something that's ultimately less value for the company but we might actually be generating more value. Is there a part of that smaller hole. So there for instance that kind of comes in mind. Yeah so feel a reinvent maybe we put in 50 hours for reinvent and reinvent hugely successful but there are a zillion other people working on that as well and like how do we determine how much impact our participation had and that versus the other folks and then judge. Yeah so that that is not a KPI that's that's on here now corporate it's a corporate events is not on there that's a great call I don't like this is not comprehensive right this is like a stab at. Incentivizing meaningful things that will move the needle right so we know that this team is team of subject matter experts this team knows the customer knows the product knows the market like no one else can generate the quality and type of content that we can for the web for demand generation or for field. So and we know that when we do that we know when we put stuff up on the web like it drives outcomes for the business we know that when we do field events it drives outcomes for the business and that's why those are on the OK ours as well so this is like kind of picking the low hanging fruit of like we know this does drive business outcomes that's why we want to track it. Yeah for something like a you know commit. You know we're putting amazing amounts of time in the commit how do we get credit for that as a PMM team i'm not i don't know yet. Right well yeah and how do we know like part of it's getting credit is part of it is just knowing where to spend our time if we can if we can double if we can double the value of something that's worth a third as much versus increasing it 5% you know somewhere else. Yeah so i've to have two bits of guidance on that right so. um well let's think of do that for the most so I would say one if if there is some project something that you believe if I invest my time and think acts it will meaning fully move this needle like to your point is like this could this could like increases by 50% not just 5% Like that should be easy to justify even if it's not like a specific KPI and maybe let's like have a conversation about it right like let's bring that maybe the whole team should be doing that thing whatever that is right so like if you see that thing and you're like I can have big impact here. That should be like the overarching decision matrix right like as you're looking at like all the stuff you spend your time on like what's driving meaningful goals um. The other one is like we got to keep the lights on right or what we call like business like businesses usual so like this doesn't track like sales enablements this doesn't track. messaging and positioning really like it's oh it's okay our for us but we're not like you know we don't have like a KPI that's like how many people used our messaging like there's things that we need to do as a team that's that's. We're probably not ever going to be able to track but they're important things to do. Right and yeah i'm just curious I know you're in some product marketing. Association or something do they have like a library of things that they share where you could see examples of what other people do they do so. The the challenge is is how so i've looked i looked at all of that as well and they do actually there's a pts they put out if I can if I can track down the pdf i'll share that with a group. The nutshell of it is that pmm works really differently in different places right so in in other orgs product marketing owns campaigns they don't have like there is no Jackie's team like this team is Jackie's team and like this team has an mql number that they need to hit. But like that doesn't make sense for us because like we're not the campaigns team. In in other orgs product marketing might even own like a revenue number right like when I was at Twilio like every product team function pretty much autonomously like the PM was a little CEO and the PMM was a little CMO. And we were responsible for our business like we had a weekly meeting where we had like this is the revenue that our product is generating and the marketing plan had to contribute to driving revenue for the product. But we don't work that way right so in in. Like the things that other so these are metrics that have come from other so there are things like other PMM orgs they track their web content performance. Um they track their webinar content performance right they track like the demand gen content that PMM generates those are those are things that other orgs do. Um some of those other metrics though are like don't make sense for us. Is bounce rate set and so do we know like what pages that focuses on I've always been a little iffy on bounce rate in general right because if it's a page if the intent is to have multiple views. If you if the intent is to go to multiple pages or multiple views and a high bounce rate is good right. No no no so bounce bounce rate measures like. If somebody lands on the page and that contents like not meaningful to them. Like because you have bounce rate and you have exit rate right. So this is the page bounce rate. All right so we want people to. You want to know about. On the page in because if we want people to view. If the success of the page we're talking about depends on people going to more than one page than a high bounce rate is bad. So we want people to go through a journey and go to multiple places bounce rate would be like I came to this page and I backed out of it. Right if they come if they come to a page and they're like this is the next step of my journey and then they go to that next page that's good. Okay all right so but you know the okay there's just some pages where bounce rate wouldn't make sense right because we don't want them to go anywhere else. No no no no let's let's you and I sink on on what bounce rate is because it's it's a little more nuanced than that. Okay um I will share with the team that another potential metric here might be like click through rate. So the idea would be if we identified on every one of our pages what's the next step which might be go to another page or it might be fill out a lead cap. Or like there might be some action. And then we would measure that action like was the action taken the reason I don't want to do that this quarter is because we're not instrumented for it. Yeah as I started to instantly attempt them right or you know a lot of time to show you like a symptomatic. Piece of a journey as opposed to being indicative of value but yeah well we're just we don't have the measurement for it so Google Analytics can do that but we don't have the trackers on the page to measure. Okay okay so this stuff we can measure today we'll do that for this quarter and maybe in the future we we get more granular with more specific. Um this is cool uh sales QBRs uh are optional. Um this uh this quarter we probably should chat about um what kind of async review we would want to commit to or we need to think about this if anybody has a has a proposal. I value like a proposal like I think the team should do this and then the an idea here is kind of if you think about it in like an 80 20. So like you want to get like you want to do enough research that you understand something and then you want to generate like more content out of that thing. So ideally like we're not like you know diving 50 layers deep into like customer stuff we're just like we understand the customer we know the customer the customer expert. Okay now let's go use that information and and drive our all of our other content we need to generate. So uh thank you for the time team uh let's catch up async on some of these other threads that are still going on. Cool everybody happy Monday thank you see ya.\n"

I did the entire 24 hour live chat when that was a mistake. But I'm going to try to be in there for as many chats as possible because I don't think I think there are. I know of some cases where the speakers won't be able to make it. Or be sure there's someone in there to answer the chat questions. Yeah, I'm doing the same thing.

So for example, I need to get I have a call Ryan this week. I want to get like a full list of what can we expect for RFIs and reports so we can plan that bandwidth, right? Similarly, there are things on here like our corporate event support. I think these ones we've are well documented, which ones we're covering, the field marketing events. So ideally, what we're doing here and I see that some folks have already kind of started to chime in and been like, yeah, I can pick up this one.

Here we have a list. And then it has a link here. And this is the list of proposed field events. So we did this last quarter and got I think eight. This quarter we got 18. That gives me a little bit more confidence that we're more a little bit more comprehensive. So I have an action item to go through these and try to I might pop them in a spreadsheet or something so that we can look at like how many is partner doing? How many is core Mac doing, you know, any any questions on just the webinars for the quarter? So you want us to \n",

So you want us to put in what we are signed up to or you want us or you're putting them in based upon the request. So ideally we kind of like batch process these. What I'd like to do if I ever get like five minutes of extra time that I'm not, you know, just jammed with stuff. Commit commit is taking like a meaningful amounts of my time. But in an ideal world. This list here. Like what do I want? And in some ways this is nice because this is, you know, all in issues. So, but it's kind of makes it cumbersome to filter. So ideally what I could do is I could look at this and I could say like, are these evenly distributed across the team? Because everyone on the team, are they picking up a few, right?

You might think we can manage this by like we could sign up. We could look at the list and assign ourselves to the ones that we think are appropriate. And we can self manage if we've got too many in one week or big conflicts. We can say, Hey, I can't do this. Can somebody else do this? Yeah, that's a good, that's a good call. There's I don't the managing conflicts versus your projects is I think good. We need some type of all team collaboration. We need, we need some way.

You need to farm some of those out because sometimes I'm able to reuse content from one to the other. Some, they're all DevSecOps topics. Some of it was on, I was the spokesperson for the DevSecOps survey. So a bunch of them came from that. And honestly, I just tend to have more of those and of the customer meetings than other people. And maybe I have less of something else. I don't, I feel like it's a little bit artificial to feel like you've got to distribute it for us. I have a list somewhere I'll be putting it in.

So we'll need to look as a team what launches are coming up even. And we just need to make sure that our kind of our priorities are in sync and that we have coverage across. So I'm not necessarily saying like, we need to kind of artificially flow it. And I definitely don't necessarily want to like, dull out like you're doing this one, you're doing this one. But I do want to make sure that there's some spread across the team, right? Oh, I do want to make sure that like, everyone's at least doing some events. And I do want to make sure that we cover them.

And then frankly, I like, I personally lost a meaningful, significant chunk of the chunk of my time last quarter due to field last minute asking me for stuff. And I had to shift things around and I had to like chat with FMM managers and like, I don't have time for that this quarter. So like the last quarter we did like, everybody just grab events and I prefer that. I like, I prefer decentralized, but like, I cannot commit the time this quarter to like, I fell through the cracks and what do we miss? So I need to be injected somewhere in there to say like, look, we have a plan that I feel good about. And like, my time won't be sucked some point at the future. Is that kind of fair?

We just, we need them to all be covered and we need them to not. So, so what we also need to do too is across these 18 events, like some of these are for PMM and some of these are for PMM. So that's, that's all it just, it just needs to be managed like, I am not comfortable saying like, go and sign up for stuff and then I'll just see what doesn't get signed up for. Why not? Because that didn't work last quarter and it was extremely painful. What didn't, what part of it didn't work?

That's what we're going to do. So if there are ones that you want to sign up for, go ahead and comment in there. This will be part of the process this quarter. Instead of commenting, if we assign it, then you could, you could do a board or a filter for which ones are not assigned or, you know, which ones are assigned to, to each of us. I'm just a thought. Well, there's problems with that too though. Like, like some of these are already assigned to people, some are assigned to multiple people. Like they're not, they're not consistent.

So, in your contribution, I think, is the metric. Well, so there's two, there's two elements here. And we got to, we should chat in a moment about KPIs. So KPIs are going to be different than OKRs, but they are related. So here, the, the OKR, the key result for this objective is to increase funnel velocity and drive pipeline. So yes, by the, as we look at these events, if we can't pick up all of them, then ideally, we're asking questions like, like, which one of these, what's the revenue potential. And we make sure that we pick up the ones that are the most. Like we're prioritizing, we're prioritizing based on the key \n",

And so, you know, we're doing this for the case of the CODA, we're doing this for the case of the CODA, particularly. I don't know that we're to that level of sophistication yet. Like I said, this is like a step of maturity up from what we did last quarter, but eventually, like, ideally what we would have is for these KRs, we would say, we're doing this and we expect this out of it. Certainly on any of these that that is the lens to look through is like hey for this we're trying to drive pipeline. So we're trying to get these finalize one else. Okay, so one other element to this is. This is the OKR epic. So this has Craig's three OKRs.

So I just anyway, I just noticed that. But here's an example of like product marketing reposition free product individuals and paid product to business. Honestly, I'm like just double clicking at this now because I'm trying to think like how does this align to this. I'm also wondering if that is that public. No, yeah, it's not confidential. Yeah, these are all public. I think this was this was one of the ideas that Craig had for the pricing page AB test where he said that our message on the free should say for individual users and for the paid to say for business users or enterprise users or something like that.

Honestly, we didn't like you can see in our doc. We went from like Craig's to the teams. So we didn't go to that level. The one that I know about is. For example, here. In this messaging and positioning. We have. This golden pitch, right. So this is something that. Core Mac is leading up, which is like. Golden pitch certification. And honestly, some of this also needs to be. Rethought now we were going to run this at contribute. So maybe we, I don't know if there's a still on the docket and we run it at.

And then it cascades right down. So Core Mac will be the a sign here. Like this will literally be. Core Mac is leading this project. Ideally for each of these things, we have. An okay R issue in this marketing planning. Project. And that's on my like Tracy's already logged all of her. So this is like a to do for me to do. The reason I want to bring it up to the team now is because it means we'll have some duplication. And then you know, if you're working on your stuff and you can, you can organize it and structure it.

In some cases, like you might, you yourself might be assigned to that. Any kind of questions on just this, the okay R sort of planning the way they're trying to roll it up. So KPIs. So we had a solid discussion on this last time. And we've iterated here. This has been reviewed with Craig. And so the idea here with okay R's, those are quarterly, right?

I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I've been sold by the team. That we want more of a direct line. So as an example, if we say okay, well, we're delivering web content. So we're going to be responsible for something like, you know, inquiries on the website. If we're just responsible for the total inquiries number and we share that with say Danielle's team. So that's what we're going to do. So we're going to be doing a team that's going to be like who's actually responsible. Is it us or Danielle? And then be lik\n",

And then be like, we don't contribute to all the inquiries. That doesn't really make sense. The idea is that we as a team should be incentivized to make them successful. Like we as a team work horizontally across teams and marketing. So that's why you see like alignment with Danielle's team, alignment with Dunks team, alignment with Evans team. So that's the horizontal and then here is the the ideally we're trying to tie it more of a straight lines of the work we do. So quite frankly, I don't know how we're going to instrument for this. We start to get back into some of the some of the goofiness we have in the past. I think there's a few guardrails here.

Like we should just have a web dashboard that is like this is the web content that we put out and we can track things like page use and about to rate. I think this is great. It's a move in the right direction. I think page views is still a little bit goofy because like like we discussed previously as well, we. We don't have control on how people are going to land on this page. Yes, we can do a little bit of SEO, but if the solution is not let's say at the top of the. On our homepage header, then nobody's going to be able to find a particular page.

Because it shows that if a customer is not engaged on that content, then they would move bounce rate is one and time on page is is the other metric that we could look at rather than having page views that's not. So we we need to track if the content is valuable, for example, from an essay, a perspective, if if people are searching and landing on that page. And if a page is valuable in a customer journey, we need to be incentivized as a team to collaborate with the rest of marketing to get it into that flow. So what metric would you propose to incentivize those things? So if it's about collaboration and working on the journey, then page views is a good metric, right, because then we need to think about it from a customer's point of view, customer lands on the front page, then wants to say let's say wants \n",

Because it's not part of the top header solution header that we have on our homepage and we don't expose the solution tab anymore on our homepage other than at the footer of the page right and there are many, many such pages like that we don't have one specifically for continuous delivery as an example. So if we have to work with the extended team to get that in place, then we need an overall information architecture like we spoke about right like how do we, what's the journey that the customer needs to take and what use cases that we want to showcase to the customer and only those are things that \n",

Right so the, essentially we want to have a decision matrix like I'm going to have page A or page B which one should I invest time in should I generate a new page or should I refresh an existing page like overall views is something that like page views on PMM page content is something that we want to track.

But this is kind of like a quantity and a quality metric so we want to look at both of those we both want to get like and then I again it's like the idea here is like if we generate more top of funnel volume in this case we're measuring that by page views but that the assumption there is that it's a leading metric to feed things like inquiries and self service.

So similarly here for demand gen content. I don't know again I don't know how we're going to instrument for this it is i'll tell you what it will not be is it this will not be us architecting our own separate machine like for all of these like whatever we measure like this measure like these measures need to come through Google analytics like through the whatever the web normative.

Path factory and it's PMM contributed like we should be able to pull a number out of that I don't know how we're going to instrument for that i'm open to ideas. This one should be a lot easier.

The nutshell of it is that pmm works really differently in different places right so in in other orgs product marketing owns campaigns they don't have like there is no Jackie's team like this team is Jackie's team and like this team has an mql number that they need to hit. But like that doesn't make sense for us because like we're not the campaigns team. In in other orgs product marketing might even own like a revenue number right like when I was at Twilio like every product team function pretty much autonomously like the PM was a little CEO and the PMM was a little CMO. And we were responsible for our business like we had a weekly meeting where we had like this is the revenue that our product is generating and the marketing plan had to contribute to driving revenue for the product.

Um some of those other metrics though are like don't make sense for us.

All right so we want people to. You want to know about. On the page in because if we want people to view. If the success of the page we're talking about depends on people going to more than one page than a high bounce rate is bad. So we want people to go through a journey and go to multiple places bounce rate would be like I came to this page and I backed out of it. Right if they come if they come to a page and they're like this is the next step of my journey and then they go to that next page that's good.

No no no no let's let's you and I sink on on what bounce rate is because it's it's a little more nuanced than that. Okay um I will share with the team that another potential metric here might be like click through rate. So the idea would be if we identified on every one of our pages what's the next step which might be go to another page or it might be fill out a lead cap. Or like there might be some action. And then we would measure that action like was the action taken the reason I don't want to do that this quarter is because we're not instrumented for it.

      "1. Tracking individual page performance (e.g., a specific \"self service\" page) in terms of user engagement and success metrics.\n",
      "2. Measuring the contribution of web pages to downstream processes, such as inquiries and sign-ups.\n",
      "\n",
      "They agree that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Page views will be used to track these contributions.\n",
      "* However, they cannot create their own custom measurement tools (e.g., not building a separate machine).\n",
      "* Instead, they need to work within existing measurement frameworks, likely through Google Analytics or similar tools.\n",
      "* Their key performance indicators (KPIs) must align with these external measurements.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 27 ---\n",
      "The transcript appears to be from a meeting about tracking metrics for demand generation (PMM, or Paid Media Marketing). The speaker suggests that their current KPI measurement tool is not sufficient and proposes using an existing dashboard to track key metrics such as inquiries, leads, MQLs, and linear attribution. However, they acknowledge that this dashboard does not currently include a metric for PMM content.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposes creating a new metric by segmenting out the PMM content from other pipeline-driving activities, and suggests that this should be relatively easy to do. They express an openness to ideas on how to instrument (measure) this new metric.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 28 ---\n",
      "The transcript appears to be a meeting discussion about measuring field events in Salesforce. The speaker suggests creating a more streamlined process by avoiding unnecessary extra tasks, such as reviewing content or coding, that were part of an earlier project. They propose simply analyzing the list of events for the quarter and pulling linear attribution from existing Salesforce objects, specifically for PMM contributed events. There is no other notable discussion points mentioned in the transcript.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 29 ---\n",
      "The transcript appears to be a meeting discussion about the company's measurement and attribution efforts, specifically regarding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The conversation touches on:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Attribution: The group is trying to figure out how much of the company's revenue comes from their contributions. They're discussing the idea of attributing 10-20% of the value to their efforts.\n",
      "2. Time allocation: With a limited budget, they need to decide how to allocate time and resources to different areas, such as \"reinvent\" (which is mentioned but not fully explained in the transcript).\n",
      "3. Prioritization: The discussion highlights the challenge of prioritizing which areas to focus on given competing demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the conversation seems to be about finding a way to measure and optimize their efforts more effectively, while also considering the potential value of investing time into different areas within the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 30 ---\n",
      "This transcript appears to be a meeting discussion about KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for corporate events, particularly those related to demand generation and field activities. The conversation centers around measuring the impact of these efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker expresses concerns that the proposed KPIs are not comprehensive and may not accurately capture the effectiveness of their participation in events. They suggest that it's challenging to determine the individual team's contribution when there are many other teams working on similar initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, they emphasize that this team has a unique advantage due to its expertise in subject matter, customer knowledge, and product understanding, which enables them to produce high-quality content that drives business outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker seems to be advocating for alternative approaches that focus on meaningful impact rather than traditional KPIs. They mention the idea of \"reinvent\" with 50 hours of effort but also acknowledge the challenges in measuring their team's contribution amidst other competing efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the conversation revolves around finding effective ways to measure and incentivize meaningful contributions from this team, emphasizing their unique strengths and capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 31 ---\n",
      "The meeting transcript appears to be discussing metrics and strategies for demand generation and field events, particularly in relation to project management (PMM) teams. The main points from the conversation are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Both web content and field events have proven to drive business outcomes, making them important areas of focus.\n",
      "* Tracking these activities is crucial to understand their impact on the business.\n",
      "* The team wants to prioritize efforts that drive the most significant value, such as doubling the effectiveness of existing initiatives rather than just increasing efficiency by a small margin (e.g., from 3% to 5%).\n",
      "* There seems to be an implicit concern about how PMM teams can effectively measure and receive credit for their work, but this point is not explicitly stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the conversation appears to center around optimizing resource allocation and measurement of effectiveness for demand generation and field events.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 32 ---\n",
      "The meeting transcript discusses two different approaches to decision-making:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Investing in something that has the potential to increase a significant outcome (50% or more), such as a project, and making it a priority by bringing the whole team together to focus on it.\n",
      "2. Prioritizing business-as-usual operations to \"keep the lights on\" and maintain stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is seeking guidance on how to balance these two approaches and is open to discussing the decision matrix for prioritizing tasks and investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 33 ---\n",
      "The transcript appears to be a meeting discussion between two individuals, likely in a product marketing role or related field. Here is a summary of their conversation:\n",
      "\n",
      "* They discussed the importance of setting meaningful goals for personal productivity and time management.\n",
      "* They agreed that some tasks are essential but may not have measurable KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), such as maintaining business operations (\"keeping the lights on\") or doing important team work.\n",
      "* One person inquired about a library of examples shared by product marketing associations, suggesting they wanted to see best practices and examples of what others do in similar roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the transcript does not include any additional information from the PDF mentioned, but it appears that one person found a valuable resource (a PPT?) from a product marketing association that they would like to share with a group.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 34 ---\n",
      "The speaker discusses challenges in implementing Product Marketing (PMM) practices, citing differences between their organization and others. They mention that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* In other organizations, PMM often owns specific campaigns or metrics, such as an MQL number.\n",
      "* However, this approach doesn't fit the speaker's organization because they are not the campaign team.\n",
      "* In some companies, like Twilio where they were previously based, product marketing was autonomous and responsible for driving revenue. They had a weekly meeting to review revenue and marketing plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is looking for advice or best practices on implementing PMM effectively in their own organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 35 ---\n",
      "The meeting transcript appears to be discussing metrics used by other Product Management (PMM) organizations, specifically in marketing. The speaker mentions that these metrics are not necessarily relevant or useful for their organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some examples of metrics mentioned include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Web content performance\n",
      "* Webinar content performance\n",
      "* Demand generation content performance\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the speaker expresses skepticism about some of these metrics, such as bounce rate. They argue that a high bounce rate might actually be a good thing if multiple views are intended, but not if it's meant to be a single view.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall tone is one of questioning and criticism towards the common metrics used in PMM organizations, suggesting that their organization may need to adapt or find alternative metrics that better suit their needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 36 ---\n",
      "The speaker discusses the concept of bounce rate in the context of multiple views or pages on a website. They clarify that a high bounce rate is actually bad, as it indicates users are not engaging with the content and may be leaving early.\n",
      "\n",
      "To measure success, the goal is for users to view multiple pages as part of a journey, rather than simply bouncing off one page. A low bounce rate would indicate a user's progress through the site, while a high bounce rate would suggest they're abandoning the site prematurely.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some exceptions where a bounce rate might not be relevant, such as pages that don't require users to leave or continue browsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 37 ---\n",
      "This transcript appears to be from a meeting about website analytics, specifically bounce rate. The speaker is discussing how bounce rate might not always accurately measure user behavior on certain pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "They suggest that instead of focusing solely on bounce rates, they could also track click-through rates and other actions taken on each page, such as filling out a lead form or taking another step in the conversion process. However, they note that this approach requires instrumentation, which they are not currently set up for.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is hesitant to rely solely on bounce rate because it can be a \"symptomatic piece of a journey\" rather than an indicator of value, meaning it doesn't necessarily capture the full user experience or conversion potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 38 ---\n",
      "The transcript appears to be a meeting discussion about measuring the effectiveness of sales QBRs (Sales Quality Business Requirements) without an existing measurement framework. Here's a summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The team acknowledges the need for a measurement approach, but notes that they currently don't have one in place.\n",
      "* Google Analytics can provide some metrics, but their tools are not available on the page to measure specific aspects.\n",
      "* A decision is made to focus on measuring certain aspects of sales QBRs this quarter and potentially expand to more granular measures in the future.\n",
      "* Sales QBRs are optional, but the team discusses the possibility of implementing an asynchronous review process (async review) for QBRs.\n",
      "* The 80/20 rule is mentioned as a guideline to balance research with generating content from that research, avoiding unnecessary depth.\n",
      "* The discussion concludes with a call to action for anyone to propose a specific async review approach or idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Summarizing Chunk 39 ---\n",
      "The meeting transcript appears to be a brief discussion about content generation and customer expertise. The speaker suggests:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Conducting research to gain in-depth understanding of customers\n",
      "* Using this knowledge to generate more content that resonates with the target audience\n",
      "* Avoiding excessive, detailed analysis of customer information (e.g., only focusing on surface-level understanding)\n",
      "\n",
      "The meeting concludes with a thank you, acknowledgement of other ongoing threads, and a farewell.\n",
