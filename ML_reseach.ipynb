      " - [00:00] Emma: Alright, team, before we talk creative or budget, I want to start with the analytics.\n",
      " - [00:00] Emma: How are we actually performing compared to last month?\n",
      " - [00:06] Sofia: Overall traffic is up 12%, but conversions dropped from 3.2% to 2.7%.\n",
      " - [00:06] Sofia: The click-through rates are healthy—it’s the post-click engagement where we’re losing people.\n",
      " - [00:14] David: That matches what sales is seeing.\n",
      " - [00:14] David: We’re getting more leads, but the percentage that actually respond to follow-up calls is lower.\n",
      " - [00:14] David: So, a quality issue.\n",
      " - [00:21] Liam: From a cost perspective, our cost per click is stable, but cost per acquisition has gone up about 18%.\n",
      " - [00:28] Emma: Could this be seasonal?\n",
      " - [00:28] Emma: Or is it more about the targeting getting too broad?\n",
      " - [00:31] Sofia: Seasonality plays a small part, but I think it’s more audience drift.\n",
      " - [00:31] Sofia: We’ve been expanding our targeting pool to reach new prospects, and they’re less ready to buy.\n",
      " - [00:39] David: And when leads aren’t ready, the sales cycle lengthens, which delays revenue.\n",
      " - [00:39] David: That’s exactly what we’re seeing—more conversations, fewer closes.\n",
      " - [00:46] Liam: There’s also something odd in the channel breakdown.\n",
      " - [00:46] Liam: Paid social is up in spend but delivering fewer conversions than organic search, which hasn’t even increased in budget.\n",
      " - [00:54] Emma: Sofia, do you think it’s an ad creative issue, or maybe the targeting on social just isn’t aligned?\n",
      " - [01:00] Sofia: The creative hasn’t been refreshed in a while, and we’re still serving the same messages to repeat viewers.\n",
      " - [01:00] Sofia: Engagement drops when content feels stale.\n",
      " - [01:07] David: I’d also say some of the value props we highlight in ads don’t match what’s resonating on sales calls.\n",
      " - [01:07] David: Customers are asking about things we barely mention.\n",
      " - [01:15] David: Mainly the flexibility in our service packages.\n",
      " - [01:15] David: That’s been closing deals, but it’s buried in the fine print on the website.\n",
      " - [01:20] Liam: If that’s driving conversions, we should test highlighting it in ads and see if the quality of leads improves.\n",
      " - [01:25] Sofia: I can run A/B tests with that as the primary hook.\n",
      " - [01:28] Emma: Let’s make sure we track the entire funnel on that.\n",
      " - [01:28] Emma: I want to see if better messaging reduces cost per acquisition.\n",
      " - [01:37] Emma: Anything else in the analytics we should flag before we move on?\n",
      " - [01:40] Sofia: Could be a site speed issue or layout problem on smaller screens.\n",
      " - [01:46] David: If the mobile checkout flow is clunky, that would explain some of the drop in conversions.\n",
      " - [01:50] Emma: If mobile performance is costing us sales, we need to fix it before any big campaigns.\n",
      " - [01:54] Liam: I can run a quick speed audit and check layout responsiveness.\n",
      " - [01:58] Sofia: And if it’s a design problem, we might need to involve the UX team for a layout refresh.\n",
      " - [02:02] David: UX changes might take longer, but if it boosts conversions, the ROI could be huge.\n",
      " - [02:06] Emma: Alright, while Liam looks into speed and Sofia checks the creative, David, can you sync with sales to get fresh customer feedback?\n",
      " - [02:14] Sofia: Also, we might want to add a post-purchase survey to see why people are actually buying.\n",
      " - [02:14] Sofia: That could sharpen our ad messaging.\n",
      " - [02:18] Liam: We can automate that in the CRM so responses go straight to the analytics dashboard.\n",
      " - [02:22] Emma: I want us to be more proactive in catching these trends instead of reacting after the fact.\n",
      " - [02:26] David: On that note, maybe we should set up a quarterly audit process—full funnel, from impressions to retention.\n",
      " - [02:30] Sofia: And we could run a smaller monthly check-in just to see if we’re drifting from our goals.\n",
      " - [02:34] Liam: I can configure the reporting so that we get automated alerts when certain KPIs fall below thresholds.\n",
      " - [02:42] David: By the way, have we looked into competitor activity?\n",
      " - [02:42] David: Sometimes a sudden drop is because they’ve launched something new.\n",
      " - [02:46] Sofia: One of our main competitors rolled out a big discount campaign.\n",
      " - [02:46] Sofia: It’s probably pulling some of our ready-to-buy audience.\n",
      " - [02:50] Liam: We don’t have to match discounts, but maybe we could highlight value instead—better service, longer warranties.\n",
      " - [02:54] Emma: Competing on price is a race to the bottom.\n",
      " - [02:58] David: And those differentiators should be front and center in both ads and sales scripts.\n",
      " - [03:02] Sofia: We can also test dynamic creative optimization to tailor messages to different audience segments.\n",
      " - [03:06] Emma: Let’s aim to review early results in two weeks and see what’s moving the needle.\n",
      " - [03:10] Liam: Before we wrap, can we talk about the attribution model?\n",
      " - [03:10] Liam: I’m noticing that some conversions are being double-counted between paid search and email.\n",
      " - [03:15] Sofia: Right now, our tracking is set to last-click, but for multi-touch journeys, it’s skewing credit.\n",
      " - [03:20] David: Sales has also flagged that some of the ‘converted leads’ are actually repeat customers.\n",
      " - [03:20] David: That’s inflating the numbers.\n",
      " - [03:25] Emma: Alright, so we need to clean up data integrity first.\n",
      " - [03:25] Emma: Liam, can you propose a multi-touch attribution model that actually reflects reality?\n",
      " - [03:30] Liam: We could try a time-decay model or position-based attribution.\n",
      " - [03:30] Liam: Both would give more balanced credit.\n",
      " - [03:34] Sofia: If we go position-based, we’ll need to retrain the team on interpreting the numbers.\n",
      " - [03:38] Emma: Better to have accurate data that’s harder to read than easy-to-read data that’s wrong.\n",
      " - [03:42] David: Speaking of accurate data, I think our lead scoring is outdated.\n",
      " - [03:42] David: We’re still using criteria from two years ago.\n",
      " - [03:47] Liam: That could explain why sales is wasting time on low-quality leads.\n",
      " - [03:47] Liam: I can pull the historical close-rate data and rework the scoring.\n",
      " - [03:51] Sofia: If the wrong kinds of leads are converting, the messaging might be attracting the wrong audience.\n",
      " - [03:56] Emma: Let’s make sure this isn’t just a top-of-funnel problem.\n",
      " - [04:00] David: Right now, if someone doesn’t convert in the first week, they’re basically forgotten.\n",
      " - [04:05] Sofia: We can extend the email nurturing timeline.\n",
      " - [04:05] Sofia: Add more value-driven content, case studies, maybe a limited-time offer after 30 days.\n",
      " - [04:10] Liam: And track reactivation rates.\n",
      " - [04:10] Liam: If that works, it’s a relatively low-cost way to boost revenue.\n",
      " - [04:14] Emma: Every percent increase in reactivation is basically free money.\n",
      " - [04:18] David: One more thing—I think we should start recording sales calls for analysis.\n",
      " - [04:18] David: We can use AI to detect sentiment and objections.\n",
      " - [04:22] Sofia: It would let us align marketing and sales messaging much more closely.\n",
